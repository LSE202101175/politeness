. Cadet Bennett is a very selfless and caring individual. She even got Cadet Smith and myself a cake for our birthdays, which I am still very thankful for :-). Cadet Bennett constantly seeks self-improvement and has the tremendous courage to admit flaws, such as when she voluntarily stepped up to practice her marching in front of the entire wing at the start of training.. Cadet Bennett is very empathetic, which makes others very willing to follow her when she is in a position of leadership, such as her AFEX leadership position.
. Very fast learner and considerate of others in the flight; can see when other people need assistance and is always quick to offer help for her wingmen.. Diverse perspective and able to learn quickly from mistakes. She can incorporate feedback on a personal level as well as implement lessons learned into leadership roles to guide the flight to success.. Excellent attention to detail, she is able to listen well and interpret information, and then teach others, leading them to successfully complete a task. An example would be the time spent one-on-one with flight members to ensure familiarity with the AFEX software.
. Hailey was instrumental in completion of the computer exercise. She developed a plan, communicated the plan, and executed the plan. Additionally, she made adjustments as the plan was executed, showing flexibility.. Hailey made a mistake while in transit from one building to another. She was called out or her mistake. Instead of making excuses, she held herself accountable for her mistake, fixed it, and took the criticism in stride.. I found myself confused with a computer program. I went to Hailey to ask for help. She willingly made time to help me learn my way around the program, showing me how to operate it, but also enabling me to learn more about how it works on my own.
. Hailey Bennett is a caring individual and is always looking at the bright side of things.. Hailey Bennett is great at making sure people know what to do if they are assigned a task (AFEX).. Hailey Bennett is never a negative person; she sees the good in all people.
. She is a good communicator. Example: during an intel briefing she was able to effective communicate knowledge to the team for use in AFEX that effected our ability to complete a task.. She can think on her feet with little time to prepare. Example: She was able to effectively communicate an intel briefing in an impromptu manner effectively.. She has a wingman mentality. Example: she always ensure everyone's morale is high and if not she encourages others.
. You have a really good head on your shoulders and you are able to stay cool, calm and collected in every scenario.. You are really willing to help people even if you have to go out of your way for it.. You really prepared us well for the AFEX and did mess around with the organization which really helped our team pull through.",21

Morgan wanted a new bicycle and being the mean dad that I am, I told her she had to be able to ride to the end of the driveway. The driveway was a ¼ mile long and all gravel. Morgan never quit trying and eventually made it all the way to the end. This was quite an accomplishment not only because of the driveway it’s self but the bicycle was in very bad shape and very dangerous.. When Morgan was in middle school, she had a broken arm but wanted to still try out for cheerleader. She was determined not to let her injury stop her from doing what she wanted to do. I was very impressed with her determination to be successful. She even did a round off back hand spring with a cast on her arm!. Morgan was having trouble passing one of her check rides in her aviation training and was being threatened to be removed from the program. She went to the department head and expressed her love for flying and promised them, she would pass all of her check rides. I was extremely impressed with her determination to succeed and she DID!
. Generous with time. Willing to spend own time in order to accomplish something for the group such as ordering “first salute” coins for everyone.. Even in the face of negativity, still maintains a positive attitude. Such as standing out in the sun for an extensive amount of time in the heat.. Inclusive. Promotes wanting to go out with the flight and attempts to involved everyone involved. Is not overbearing about it though.

From the beginning, Cadet Arredondo has been forward thinking and willing to help since day one – always willing to step up to the plate when needed. He has remarkable dedication to standards and regulations.
. Valentin definitely has a lot of knowledge and knows how to share it. He is especially skilled in marching. Despite not being a leader, he points out the mistakes of others and then immediately shows someone how to correct it. He has helped everyone in our marching flight to increase for the better. Valentin definitely wants to be everyone's friend. He always finds a way to talk to someone new. He wants to know them and how they are doing. There isn't a person in our dorm that he doesn't know or know something about them.. Valentin has ambition. When he was a flight leader during OTS, he took the position and went the extra mile. Instead of marching in a straight line, He would march us around to get the practice for himself and others. By the end of the week, everyone was better at marching.
. Cadet Arredondo strength is his solidarity. He has always been there for anyone who need help and guidance. Personally, when I took over as flight leader he was always there to help me with my duties and to listen to me when I had doubts. We think alike and we both remind each other that when we confront a problem we need remind ourselves of the core values. Cadet Arredondo is always thinking about doing the right thing and is not afraid to act upon it.
. Cadet Arredondo is very good at helping others when he sees them struggling. He frequently will take the time to offer one on one training and takes time out of his day to do this. This shows that he genuinely wants people to succeed and that he is more than willing to share his knowledge with others without expecting anything in return.
. Valentin always leads a helping hand. He is great at marching and has assisted every flight member with that task. He has been a valuable asset especially in coaching flight leaders through open ranks inspection.
. You are very detail oriented and strive for excellence in all you do.
. He is our resident expert when it comes to marching and is a great coach for others. His corrections never come off as rude or abrasive. He knows and practices the code of praising in public & correcting in private (not in front of others).. He leads by example & serves others. A few of us (in flight 1-17) need help improving our PT scores. Arredondo volunteered to take us to the paperclip running track &spent time coaching us on running techniques. We appreciate that.. He is very knowledgeable about aircraft as well. When I have a question his answers are never sarcastic or make me feel stupid. He has great people skills that we should all learn from.
. Arredondo's time as flight leader seemed to be the time when we most gelled as a flight. He took the time and initiative to challenge us and get our performance on point.
. You are a very organized person, which is demonstrated in your daily actions and leadership roles. Your dedication to the flight is shown in how you volunteer your time to help other members improve themselves. Your selflessness is noticed and appreciated.
. Cadet Arredondo is a good teacher. He is patient and seems to really enjoy teaching. For example, he takes the time to work with everybody on their marching. When they transition into leadership roles, he ensures there is time over the weekend to practice and coaches them throughout the week. He also took the time to encourage those of us that aren't great runners and teach us the proper breathing techniques.. Cadet Arredondo steps in at the appropriate times. When we were solving the field leadership puzzle in Hoover auditorium, he stepped in to sort out which way the runways were supposed to be directed and allowed us to correctly identify one location.. Cadet Arredondo is insightful. He takes the time to think his thoughts through when he shares in class and is willing to ask questions to gain a deeper understanding.
. Before he was appointed as the official drill and ceremonies POC for the flight, Arredondo was volunteering extra time to help both new flight leaders with marching and the members of the flight still weak on their marching. He demonstrated service before self while others went inside to work on homework or just simply not be in the hot sun practicing drill, in order to better the flight as a whole.
. Valentin is an awesome wingman, mentor, teacher, and leader. No matter what he will take time to help anybody with drill. He is a great teacher who isn't condescending or rude, wish makes people respect him and want to take his advice and ask for his help.. Valentin is very knowledgeable, intelligent, and level headed. He always gives good insight during class lessons and enhances the lesson material with personal stories.. Valentin is the type of person who people want to follow. He has a positive outlook, he is caring, he is hardworking, and he is very dedicated and determined.
. Valentin does so much for people in the flight. He is always willing to take time out of his day to teach, advise and assist. Even when I seem irritated, I am always grateful and super appreciative of all he does.. Valentin allowed me to be guidon bearer when I asked. He notices me struggling but always works with me to become better. He doesn't take excuses and pushes people to be their best.
. Over the past week, Cadet Arredondo has taking the initiative to assist Cadet Jimenez with his flight leader position. Seeing as he was having difficulty, Cadet Arredondo, without question or hesitation, stepped up to the plate and became his mentor. Since last Friday, throughout SMT as well as after hours, Cadet Arredondo has been giving Cadet Jimenez pointers on how to be a successful flight leader, including one-on-one sessions with him.

Will answer questions from flight members and is very intelligent. She is good at directing and delegating tasks
. She is a very trustworthy individual and demonstrates that by following through on her areas of responsibility.. She polices the flight on a regular basis to ensure we are doing the right things at all times.. Has excellent self control and bearing which means she never needs to be watched because she always is doing the right thing.
. Ethical Leadership: Accountable for areas of responsibility and personal actions. Upholds checks and balances, along with standards.. Speaking and Writing: Very effective in articulating ideas and getting her message across.. Warrior Ethos: Always looks to hone her skills to support the team
. During the beginning of the course when she was our squadron commander, she took initiative and prepared us for the upcoming challenges of week one. Without being instructed to do so, she organized us each morning on the weekend, and prepared us in drill and ceremonies.. If there is ever a person on our flight who is feeling discouraged or unable to handle a situation, she is there to lend a hand, or an ear if the cadet only wants to talk.. She does a great job of trying to keep the flight focused. She is never afraid to speak up if there is someone or something out of order, and motivates us to be better.
. Not afraid to speak up and offer thoughts. Really helps to enforce bearing and discipline/military standards. Not afraid to volunteer or take on a task
. Always accountable for anything that she is responsible for. Often completed ahead of schedule. Is continuously seeking to develop and increase knowledge and skills that will be vital to her Air Force career. Has a clear distinction between work and private life. Has set goals and priorities that are always taken care of during work hours.
. You do a fantastic job of keeping others accountable, and leading by example.. You are very clear when you establish expectations and priorities for time management: a trait I am actively trying to improve on myself.. You are very well-spoken. You do an excellent job of expressing your thoughts and feelings through both verbal and written communication.
. Actively checks on other individuals.. Takes advantage of individual differences.. Listens thoroughly to individual issues and ideas.
. Works hard to keep team members on track. Both on schedule and helps with academic questions. Example: First week/weekend as Squadron Commander.. Motivates team members to work harder/better/smarter and faster together. Example: recommends courses of action to increase simplicity and decrease time spent accomplishing tasks.. Seeks constructive feedback and implements recommendations. Example: During peer review, she received feedback on the way she corrects other Airmen. Instead of making corrects, Cadet Dunlop now takes a softer approach and now makes recommendations to Airmen to help them get better at accomplishing tasks or actions.
. Actively seeks feedback to ensure the message was understood. Maintains checks and balances on self and others. Assesses self to identify strengths and developmental needs.
. Helps people do their best, supports others a lot. Makes sure everyone feels included. Creates a good environment
. Week 1 morale in the Squadron was not going so well. 16 hour days were very brutal at Officer Training School. As Squadron Commander, Cadet Dunlop really stepped up as leader. When performing at a meeting she came in fully prepared to improve morale to improve overall performance of the Squadron. She did this by giving each member of the Squadron a baggy for 341's with two pieces of candy. These small baggies were crucial for each Cadet to carry their 341's on them and keeping them inacceptable shape.. When I was operating CQ, I was unable to go get breakfast with my Flight. Cadet Dunlop was quick to ask me if she could get my breakfast to go for me. She also made sure I got exactly what I wanted. This showed great respect. That same day I had to lead my Flight through our Community Service event. This was a great way to start the day, especially since I was so busy in the morning with CQ. As Motivation Officer in my Flight I had a duty to post inspiration and motivation items on our Flight rooms bulletin board. Cadet Dunlop volunteered immediately to assist me on this project. This showed great teamwork. This was a duty I was given, with the understanding it must be completed ASAP. She dropped what she was doing to assist.. Cadet Ramsey really impressed me. He had some struggles early on in the program but he continued to persevere and improved every step of the way. That ability is admirable in a leader. A leader may not always have the answers but someone with Cadet Ramsey's determination will have no issues finding the answers that are needed to make sound decisions.. Cadet Ramsey also impressed me with his humility. There was a point when the MTI's asked if there were individuals that needed help with marching. Cadet Ramsey raised his hand admitting to needing help and got the extra help he needed. Now he is one of the element leaders and the extra work has paid off. At times a leader must be willing to admit they do not have all the answers.",36

His confidence spreads to other flight members. Being the challenger for groups that he participates in allows the group to think outside the box and try new ideas.
. Cadet Montgomery is a phenomenal member of FLT 1-17. From the beginning, Cadet Montgomery has been forward thinking and willing to help since day one – always willing to step up to the plate when needed. He has robust knowledge of relevant AFI, and an avid desire to continuously improve AF processes.
. Ryan's confidence is contagious. Simply put, if he believes that he can move a mountain, you won't doubt him. When he notices something doesn't seem right, he'll fight tooth and nail to see it corrected or explained.
. Ryan is a great source of information in the Air Force. He is like a jack of all trades. I've been able to go to him for help on a variety of situations and have been able to get the answer I needed. In addition he has been able to provide guidance on certain things regarding my situation.. Ryan speaks his mind. If he doesn't like something, he will tell someone and why. He says what he thinks things should be and does so in a respectful manner. This has been helpful in problem solving, course corrections, and in preparing for other exams like briefings.
. Cadet Montgomery’s strength is his determination. He is constantly challenging any inefficiencies until the problem is solved. He provides constructive criticism all the time which has been very helpful to me. A clear example, is when he took over as Wing Student Commander, he immediately determined new ways to make processes more efficient. Constantly a hard-working person and mindful of his sleep time.
. Cadet Montgomery is very knowledgeable and shares that knowledge with others. When someone is incorrect or does something they shouldn't he is quick to point it out and make corrections. This prevents others from developing bad habits and will help ham as a leader to keep his subordinates with regulation.
. Ryan is a very well organized and detailed individual. He is incredibly diligent and is always willing to conquer the task at hand. He did a great job during WELPS organizing participants and delegating tasks. During the Managing Competing Priorities he clearly understood the material at hand and was able to give very clear feedback to participants in a concise and organized manner.
. He is very smart and knowledgeable about the Air Force and it's air platforms. He leads by example and I am grateful to have him as my flight mate. He will do great things.. He has a sense of duty and protocol that I see lacking in many senior NCO's. He is very responsible and trustworthy and will a great example for his subordinates to aspire to.. He is not discouraged when he encounters a situation that he has limited knowledge on. He still gives 100% effort and will see the problem through to the best solution possible.
. Montgomery has been a big help with random things like MFRs. Often overlooked, but the help in getting them ironed out is much appreciated.
. You are among the first to volunteer to help the flight, which is appreciated. You have a wealth of knowledge in regards to military drill and ceremony. Finally, you have many great ideas that lead to flight improvement.
. The lesson in which Ryan had to play the role of a commander gave him a lot of leeway to play around with. He was voluntold into that position by a senior staff member but did not hesitate to execute. He utilized his past experiences to bring validity to his role as a commander which overall helped his flight members out by providing that sense of realism. This demonstrated his excellence in all we do, flexibility, and patience.
. Ryan is very intelligent and knowledgeable. He plays the devil's advocate but in a good way. He has provided good insight throughout our class lessons and every flight member has learned something from him.. Ryan, is a great teacher. He is caring and is always willing to step in and help others. He goes out of his way to make sure things run smoothly in the flight and speaks up when something doesn't sound right.. Ryan is a born leader. He is willing to test the bounds in a tactful way. I hope that our paths cross throughout our career. I think he is a valuable asset to our flight and I wish there were more people like him in the Air Force.
. Ryan has helped myself and others to improve our marching skills. He provides advice, constructive criticism and input on what could be improved on.
. Cadet Montgomery has been a positive influence for a lot of cadets in flight 1-17including myself. His knowledge on a wide variety of topics is unmatchable and explains every key piece of information in a calm, precise manner. His participation and feedback in class has made a huge impact on learning new topics as well as bringing many past experiences to the table for new topics of conversation. The flight would not be the same without Cadet Montgomery.",19

He then takes it further to ask how a motion is performed and will practice that motion until he is proficient and confident in it.. Brett is also a caring person. He wants people to be happy and taken care of. He is responsible for ensuring people are getting paid and tracks that. The moment he learns someone has not been paid, he immediately takes action. He does so that these people have the funds necessary to accomplish the things they do in their personal lives.. Brett is a good listener. He wants to help people and that translate into being a listener. If I'm struggling with an issue, he asks and listens very carefully before giving a response.

For example, during our WELPS event, we all were engaged in conversations about morality, absolute truth, and life beyond earth. I love to talk about those subjects especially with people that might actually know things like Smith. He is very well studied and from our conversations he seems like very cool headed as in he won’t express anger from debates.. Cadet Smith is very intelligent and has the ability to explain complex things in a simple way. As a leader he will be able to teach his subordinates and keep them up to date with current events and technology which will in turn boost the productivity of his section.. Brett is a very intelligent flight member. He displays this knowledge everyday in class but more visibly in his briefing last week and in his test scores.. He is well educated and is very ethical. I believe he will always do that right thing even in precarious situations.. He tries his best even in situations that are awkward or new for him. He takes constructive criticism and uses it to better himself.. His communication skills are strong and he makes sure to have accurate information before updating his flight mates. If he doesn't know the answer he will find the information for you and not be vague in his response.. Smith is extremely intelligent, and I enjoy the philosophical discussions we have.. Cadet Smith is extremely intelligent and well-versed in computers. He willingly shares his knowledge/helps others and took the lead on the think tank.. When Smith first found out he was potentially student squadron commander, he had the biggest dear in the headlights look. He came back to the room looking downtrodden and very stressed that first night. However, the next morning, Smith was out of bed and ready in the hallway for squadron accountability before I had even really woke up. This perseverance and change in behavior was admirable. When it really mattered, when Smith was foisted into the spotlight, he took charge and executed fully.. Brett is very intelligent and knowledgeable about a variety of topics. He is willing to help and teach others when they do not understand a subject or lesson that he is well-versed in. He is a great asset to the flight.. Brett has had two strong leadership positions at OTS. He steps up to challenges and works hard to make sure he is able to do the best job he can. He looks out for his other flight members and his leadership skills have improved from one cadet leadership position to the other. I am glad he was given the chance to be flight leader, he has the drive and determination to be the best flight leader he can be.. Brett was squadron commander and I think he did a good job. He learned a lot from being in the role and brought his gained experience and skills to the flight.. Cadet Smith has really made a huge improvement since day one. In the beginning he came off as what seemed like a very quiet and sheltered individual. A few weeks into the OTS program he was assigned the role of student squadron commander. He stepped up to the plate with minor hesitation and executed his role as a leader with the ability to adapt quickly to his new environment. His ability to transform was astounding. It’s as if he became an entirely new cadet overnight. He not only impressed myself with the amount of confidence growth he displayed but awestruck the entire Mustang Squadron.",19

He is willing to do whatever it takes to keep one's morale high through his positive nature. He is a motivator.
. Since day one, Cadet Ford has been a morale linchpin for the entire flight. Without him FLT 1-17 would truly be at a disadvantage. Everyone is grateful for his years of accrued military wisdom. He routinely sets a high bar and leads by example -- a model Airman -- he will without a doubt be the officer that today's Air Force needs.
. Chris is a good dad. That's enough.
. Talented, Inquisitive, Self-starter Since Chris was a child, he’s always been curious about the way things work. By the time he was 6, he was taking apart radios just to see what was inside. In time, his efforts began to pay off as he learned to modify radio control cars and trucks and create “souped up” versions of the vehicles. When Chris was 8, he began to “discover” my video editing equipment. In those days(mid 1990s) video editing was a daunting task and was just beginning to use computers. I spent hours trying to learn how to use the editing computer and was elated when I finally learned to use some of the special effects the computer would do. One day, I left Chris in the studio by himself. When I came back, he was sitting at the editing computer watching a person giving a speech on TV, and spinning the speaker's head off the screen. He hadn’t read the 500 page system manual, but rather “just figured it out, Dad"". At age 13, Chris became interested in Ham Radio, and became the youngest licensed Amateur Radio Operator in Kerrville, and one of the youngest in Texas. Chris helped with the family photography/video production business while we lived in Port Aransas and after we moved to Kerrville. After graduating from High School, Chris enrolled in the University of Texas at San Antonio (USE), and one year later, transferred to Texas A&M Corpus Christi(TAMCC), where he started out as a Business Administration major. However, in 2007, an event occurred that changed Chris’ life. I was working in the local TV station when the owners needed a temporary person to write local news copy for the noon broadcast. They asked me if I could recommend anyone, and after a quick phone call, I recommended Chris, who was just completing the semester at TAMCC. I knew he could write well, and he was game for something new which might pay him a few dollars. Chris worked for a few days with the Station Manager and learned how to gather news stories from everything from the local police blotter to state and national feeds and then script a broadcast and load it to the teleprompter for the anchors to read. About a week after Chris started at the station, the rains came and continued until a major flood hit Kerrville. One day, Chris, a newly hired technician, and I made it in to work, but nobody else could get in. The station normally had 2 news anchors, but there was no way they could make it in. To make matters worse, the station had been hit by lightning, and when we arrived, we found the entire computer network off-line. I went to the control room to begin repairs, and Chris tackled the computer network in another part of the building. At about 15 minutes before we were scheduled to go live, as I was wondering how we were going to pull off a noon newscast, I happened to look down into the studio and saw Chris sitting at the news desk, wearing a coat, shirt, and tie that one of the anchors had left at the station. He called up to me in the control room and told me he was ready, so when noon came, I switched live to the studio and Chris handled the 30 minute show as if he’d done it many times before. He was a natural, and read the teleprompter more smoothly than people who had been doing it for years. The rain continued, and Chris and I found ourselves running crawls with emergency information in the middle of the night. The next day, one of the anchors managed to make it in, Chris filled the shoes of the other anchor (who he met for the first time that morning), and the newscast went off smoother than before. The next day, Chris set up and ran audio for a visiting folk music group, and from the look on his face, it was evident that he was enjoying every minute of the job. A couple of days later, when everything was back to normal, and Chris was heading back to Corpus Christi, we stopped by the station to say “goodbye”. While I was talking to the owners, I happened to look into the studio and saw Chris sitting in a dark studio behind the news desk. He looked over to me and said, “I could really get used to this"". Later, when he got back to school, Chris changed his major from Business to Communications with an emphasis in broadcasting. He then applied to the Corpus Christi ABC affiliate for a job in the news department, and ended up with a paid internship as a production assistant to the station for the remainder of his time at TAMCC. Chris joined the Air Force initially, to work in a broadcast job in the Armed Forces Network (AFN) or some related field, but by the time he finished Basic Military Training (BMT) he had volunteered for the weather career field, where he has had a very successful career. Chris will ably carry this drive and  “can do” approach to the task ahead with him as a Logistics Readiness Officer.
. Artistic Chris is a talented musician and photographer. His first encounter with music came at age 7 when he became interested in drums. By the time he was 8, he was taking lessons, and his mother and I had invested in earplugs. When we moved to Kerrville in 1998, one of the primary criteria as we searched for a house was that it have enough room for drums. During this period, we were homeschooling Chris and had joined the Hill Country Homeschool Association which had a very good music program. Chris still maintained his interest in drums during those years, but also started playing the flute. He played in the Hill Country Homeschool Orchestra with musicians from a 4 county area, and was quite good. In 2004, Chris and some of his homeschool friends transferred to the local public-school to play basketball for their Junior and Senior years. It was during this period that Chris and some of his friends decided to form a band. At first he played drums, but soon was fascinated with guitars, so he ended up teaching himself to play guitar. Following graduation from High School, Chris attended the University of Texas San Antonio (UTSA) and continued to play in a band with some of his friends. After a year at UTSA, Chris transferred to Texas A&M Corpus Christi (TAMCC), along with a couple of his band friends , and the band grew. The next thing we knew, Chris had taught himself to play the keyboard, and is quite accomplished on that instrument too. Chris’ artistic talents aren’t only musical. He has always had a good eye for photography, and when we lived in Port Aransas, he was invaluable to the photography/video production business we owned. He has a natural ability to frame a shot and catch action that he sees but other people would miss. In those days, we photographed a lot of fishing tournaments and he captured lots of great shots which were published in the local paper. His picture of a dolphin, titled “Follow Me”, was selected for the cover of the Port Aransas Visitors Guide one year. The important thing about Chris’ artistic talent is that it provides a window to how he interacts with other people. He has a natural ability to see things in a picture that I miss. He also has the same ability in his interactions with people; to help them develop their strengths, and overcome their weaknesses. Chris also listens ... to people just as he does to music. He always looks for the good in people and projects a quiet strength that that seems to transfer to those with whom he comes into contact. This has been especially comforting to those who are undergoing personal struggles or feeling sadness or loss.
. Leader Chris’ leadership qualities are a product of his basic personality, life experiences, and extensive study of history and profiles of people who have had a profound effect on society. I think Chris’ homeschool experience “lit the fire” and helped him begin to develop his natural leadership skills. We were part of the Hill Country Homeschool Association, a group of homeschooling parents who got together and provided activities to augment the students’ basic homeschool curriculum. The association sponsored field trips, sporting activities, an orchestra, writing groups, art classes, and much more. In this environment, students learned to be thoughtful and helpful to each other. Students with strengths in certain areas would help other students who were struggling. Older students included younger students in various activities and learned to enjoy “mentoring” them. Students learned to assume responsibility at an early age, to take charge of a situation when appropriate, but also to support the person in charge when that was appropriate. In every situation he’s been placed in, Chris has “risen to the top”, and demonstrated the leadership that is a part of who he is. As a result, during his tenure in the Airforce, he has won the admiration and respect of those above and below him in the chain of command. Chris’ leadership qualities have been recognized time and time again by the “usual ""Air Force mechanisms. He was an Honor Graduate in both basic training and tech school. He has been Wing Honor Guard of the Quarter, and was a Distinguished Graduate in the Airman Leadership School (ALS), just to name a few. Additionally, Chris has been promoted “early” for every rank up through his current rank of Technical Sergeant. But these “traditional” awards and recognitions only tell part of the story. They don't mention the students in Tech School who routinely turned to Chris for advice or guidance, the troubled person he befriended, or the young person who looks up to him. He is an expert in the technical aspects of his job, and naturally assumes the roles of teacher and mentor to people who work for him. Over the years, I’ve encountered many young NCOs and officers. There are a few for whom you make a mental note to watch as they go through their careers, because there's something about them that tells you that they’re “going to go to the top"". They possess a combination of genuine interest in others, positive attitude, job knowledge, military bearing, and poise that sets them above the “rank and file"". Chris Ford is one of those people. I said it first after watching him interact with his Training Instructors at graduation from Basic Military Training, have said it on several occasions since, and say it now as he graduates from Officer Training School.
. Chris is very helpful. He has a lot prior military experience and is willing to share his expertise with others. He cares about every flight member and their success here at OTS. When questions pop up, he is a great asset to lean on.
. He willingly shares his Air Force experiences with his flight mates and looks out for them. He is very patient and is never sarcastic when answering our questions.. He shares his personal trainer expertise and knowledge of physical conditioning methods to better his flight mates. He guided other cadets in their workouts at the PCC and always had time to assist them if they had questions or needed help.. He enjoys helping others and has a ""Can Do"" attitude that others can follow. He is not pretentious and does not look down upon other cadets that do not know as much. He is very observant of other's mannerisms and makes sure they understand material or jargon that is new to them.
. Ford is very knowledgeable and insightful, and is good at sharing those insights with all of us in the flight room. He is also respectful towards others and keeps up the morale where others might get cynical.
. When pressed about his stance on administering discipline during one of the lessons, Ford's ideas for justice seemed to clash with another boisterous cadet's. In that situation, it would be easy to give up one's position to avoid an argument or to just stand stubborn in your ways, but Ford was able to prevent a logical argument for his reasoning and facilitate a meaningful class discussion. He utilizes his past experiences very well and brings a nice balance to the classroom.
. Christopher is a born leader, people flock to him and want to learn from his actions and guidance.. He is extremely knowledgeable and his inputs always benefit class lessons and discussions. He is a great asset to have in class to bounce ideas off of and he is always willing to share and teach others.. He is very caring and intuitive. He is a great mentor and friend. I have learned a lot from Ford throughout this training and I know I will continue to do so once we graduate. I wish there were more people in the Air Force like Ford. He cares and looks out for his peers and subordinates, I hope that we are able to work together sometime during our careers.",15

One of the moments I can think of when you were at your best was when Alec was born and when he had his first heart surgery. You were always there to listen and just be with our family. You gave your time, your ear, your compassion and encouragement and I am forever thankful for that.. Josh, Another time I can think of when you were at your best was when I had the opportunity to attend your basic training graduation. You were so excited and thankful that mom and I were able to be there with you. You eagerly shared your experience and accomplishments. You also introduced us to your Sargent and fellow trainees and, because of your ability to form relationships, we got to go eat at one of your fellow trainees' homes. He and his family just adored you! I was so excited to see what the future could hold for you and continue to be astounded with what a wonderful man you have become. You are committed to your profession and even more so to your beautiful family. You are an amazing dad, person, brother, husband, son and friend! I love you! Ang. Josh, A third time I can think of when you were at your best is when you served our country oversees in Iraq. We were so sad and scared to see you have to leave Amy and our family yet so proud of your commitment to protect our freedom. I can only imagine what you must have been feeling that Valentine's Day when you had to leave us to travel halfway around the world into war. You handled yourself in such a brave way; reassuring us that everything would be okay and proudly supporting your fellow soldiers. Thank you for your service! I love you!
. Josh has always been an amazing brother and family person. He is great at adjusting and seeing 'the big picture' and strives to get his desired end results. Because of this(and his line of work), he has provided well for his family. He has given his children so many opportunities that without this strength, they wouldn't have. He (and his family) have moved all over the country and have seen and done so much. He is a wonderful father and his children will thank him one day for everything he does and continues to do for them.. Josh has always been an inspiration to me. He has always stood by me, even when I have done wrong by him. He has inspired me to be a good person and make good choices (which hasn't always been the case). When most people wanted to give up, Josh was there for me. He is and always has been a solid brother and friend. I am lucky to have him in my life and couldn't be prouder of the person he has become. Josh is a very loyal and loving person who is able to see the good in people.. Growing up, we didn't always have it easy. Josh struggled more with that then my sister and I. It wasn't an easy decision, but Josh prevailed in his strength and grew personally. He worked hard and made goals and accomplished those goals. He is a strong person inside and out. He prevailed when he needed to most and has become an amazing person because of it.",6

One instance was while we were dating, we were at a place where a volatile situation came about. He made sure I was in a safe place and stood in front of me until the situation was under control. I remain grateful for his calm and protective nature during that time. Secondly, during the process it took for our son to come into the world was a time of strength for Sam. It was a long, arduous process and we were unsure of how his birth would finally happen. It had been almost 24 hours at that point and he had to have been exhausted, but when the time finally came, he stood by my side and helped me through the final phase. He remains a blessing of strength for me and my son. Finally, as Sam was preparing to leave his family for this training, he may have been nervous and scared, but I saw a fierce strength in his ability to help make everything as good as could be at home while he would be away. He always chooses to show his strength at times of stress, and it makes the challenges of life easier for the rest of us.. When Sam is at his best, he is a helper and fixer. Sam has run the sound board at our church for a few years, and often our Pastor would be interested in showing a clip from a movie, or some other such media. Our system is not the best or most updated, but Sam makes sure to adapt the file or its presentation software in order for it to be used during the service. I have no doubt the Pastor has been grateful on multiple occasions for his commitment to make it work. Along those same lines, the folks who would take over that job are not quite as saavy as he is, and he made sure to make a step by step guide in order to help them be successful. On a personal level, Sam is always willing to help family and friends with their needs as well. He frequently makes adjustments on vehicles, computers and home improvements. He built new shelves for our storage area, built and installed new drawers in our pantry, and frequently helps me decipher my way through a tricky technology problem. Lastly, Sam has helped me, specifically, with stressful mental and emotional situations. While I am generally quite proud to be happy and outgoing, some life situations had brought some rough times my way. He helps me be strong and work through these troubles by listening and encouraging me to take care of myself while he supports me and continues to manage our daily lives. It is possible that I could still be struggling if he did not step in to help me. His helpful nature is a great asset to our relationship.
. When Sam is at his best, he is a role model. Sam does and gives his best in all situations. He takes pride in his work and will help others do the same. When our neighbors were gone for a bit, he mowed their lawn with the care and precision he always uses when working in his own yard. When the other neighbor was moving, he helped with some small home repairs. On more than one occasion, when we have been out in our community, he has stopped to help with certain situations. He has reached for, lifted, carried and/or moved items as necessary for others to meet their needs. During a snowy winter, he even helped our mail carrier get the truck out of a drift and up to the main street where he could make it on his own. Now, as a father, he is teaching our son to be respectful, funny, hard working and fun loving, just like him (whether he realizes it or not)! It is wonderful to watch our son grow and know he will develop the same qualities as Sam.
. Sam has a drive to research details of a subject. He is very good at comparing qualities of each item and deciding which is best for whatever the need is at that time. Part of his job is to select a vendor to buy from based on several variables. He looks at price, availability, location and decides where to buy parts for the HVAC company he worked for. The decision where to buy can change daily depending on which aspect has the highest priority at the moment. Some days the travel time is more important, others it is where he can get large quantities at the best price. He also judges quality of each item so the customer and the business both get a good deal. Sam's love of research shows in every aspect of his life including home repair, vacations, auto repair and technology. If I have a question about anything I can be assured that I can ask Sam and he will give me options and details so that I can make a good decision.. Sam has always enjoyed discipline. He was in JROTC for four years and worked his way to Battalion Commander. He fired expert in weapons and was part of the honor guard. His best discipline was the silent drill team. Sam's uniform always looked squared away. His uniform was pressed, shoes shined and brass polished. Part of the reason he made Battalion Commander was he looked so good in the uniform. Sam trained several younger cadets in the various aspects of JROTC. Through hard training and discipline their unit won several awards. I'm sure that if you put a rifle in his hands he could still spin, throw and snap to each command. Sam loves order and discipline which helped him to do very well in JROTC.. Sam always loved to learn. He did no want to miss anything. That was a big reason he had perfect attendance from second grade through his senior year of high school. Sam has always had that dedication. He had a part time job while going to college and soon landed a regular job after graduation. He was quickly promoted to a middle management position. Sam has always provided and took on many of the household chores. He has worked the same job for 8 years and helped make the company better with his forward thinking. Sam is much like his Dad. he is dedicated to his family and his job. He plans ahead and researches new information to make life easier for those around him. Sam's dedication is one of his greatest qualities.

He has hit the ground running, and ever since the beginning has excelled in everything put before him. There is nothing that will stop this individual.. Dominic is strong willed and keeps everyone afloat. Leadership comes naturally, and others flock to him when times get tough. His strength allows others to flourish.. Dominic strives to improve everyone in his team. This effort has been seen through everyone in the course, and academically we have all benefitted from his position as Academic officer.
. Cadet Kelley is an optimistic and confident individual, which is very contagious. Despite the obstacles he encountered during his Flight Leadership Position, for instance, he kept himself from getting discouraged and continued to press forward to the best of his ability.. Cadet Kelley is extremely ambitious and determined, demonstrated by his application to ENJJPT and his ultimate desire to become an astronaut.. Cadet Kelley is always willing to help others. For instance, he has never hesitated to take time out of his schedule to assist others with academics.
. Outstanding organizational skills and drive to develop and pull his wingmen forward to greater success; constantly asks wingmen how they can be helped to take a load off of teammates or to teach them how to improve in areas of his own competency..

Whether its a statement of humor or a deliverance of some obscure fact, Jeffrey commands attention; this flight would be severely disadvantaged without him. His morale boosts are top of the class, and he knows when and where to apply the right amount to reach optimal performance out of every individual. Jeffrey is a self starter. From the start of the class, the group looked to him for motivation and direction where none was. His can do attitude coupled with charisma is something to be desired in any leader. A leader who makes you want to follow him simply because he believes what he does is correct.. Jeffrey can always give cogent advice when dealing in situations that are abnormal. Following the procedures is one thing, but if something stands out that doesn't normally fit that profile, he has the answer. He helped lead us through one of the toughest ILOs simply by keeping a level head and following the leadership that was assigned him. Others soon followed suit, despite the norm of delegating tasks to others.
. Cadet McDonald always displays his good sense of humor, keeping morale high.. Cadet McDonald is very open to discussion and easy to work with, as demonstrated through an in-class case study exercise I worked on with him.. Cadet McDonald is very active in classroom discussion and vocal about his perspectives, demonstrated during lessons in the flight room.
. Very positive mindset and is able to project that out to flight members in a way that helps them re-orient a problem or a tough challenge, and look at it in a fun or humorous way.. Hardy and strong, makes him very good at leading others to confront challenging obstacles. His boldness builds confidence in others and tends to help build unit cohesion.. Uses his sense of humor and outspokenness to bolster flight morale and keep it high; this helps the flight to remain in high spirits through long days or after small failures which could have potential to bring the flight down. His ability to help others laugh off failures and learn from them to improve later is unmatched.
. Jeffrey noticed that another individual was in need of someone to help him by taking on a few additional responsibilities. Jeffrey readily stepped up to help the individual by taking the responsibilities. The tasks were accomplished successfully.. Jeffrey found himself in a situation where he had to make a call between making people happy or doing the right thing. He chose to do the right thing, executing his job with integrity. The people were unhappy, but they respected that he made the decision confidently.. Jeffrey was assigned some tasks in a field in which he was unfamiliar.

No one can claim nearly the amount of experience that he has, and everyone actively seeks to learn from him. Every scenario we encounter has been applicable, and Truman has shown us this is definitely in our realm of possibilities.. Truman has a truly exceptional adherence to rules and regulations, and a true leader has this mentality through learning. Natural born leaders are few and far between, but we are truly blessed to have him with us.. Truman's dedication to the group is a great asset that our team utilizes at every opportunity. His ability to follow orders as well as take them definitely improves unit morale and adherence to the group mentality. Truman is a great example of an effective follower!
. Cadet Smith is a very personable, approachable, and transparent individual. For instance, I found it very admirable when he opened up to everyone in the flight regarding what he was going through in being so far away from his family. These are emotions that a lot of people share in this circumstance but don't always express, so I greatly appreciated Cadet Smith's courage in bringing this topic to the forefront of conversation. Also please feel free to reach out to me if you ever need anything or want to talk.. Cadet Smith is always very eager to share his knowledge and experiences with others, as depicted by his enthusiasm to teach the EST subject matter to our flight.. Cadet Smith is extremely cooperative and great to work with. He never gives leadership problems, yet he still does not hesitate to offer his own suggestions and opinions. As the PT leader, for instance, I always catch crap and complaints regarding organized PT. While I tried to handle these complaints, Cadet Smith quickly jumped to my defense, demonstrating the respect he has for other's positions and the responsibilities that these positions entail.
. Strong military bearing and discipline; is able to lead by example and show other show to improve their uniform display, marching posture and other elements of professionalism.. Very strong inspirational motivator; uses experiences as well as goal setting to talk to and inspire wingmen in the flight to reach for new heights of personal performance.. Family-oriented and high level of maturity helps to show and teach others how to balance life and focus on accomplishing tasks while persisting through long days or tough exercises.
. Truman has a lot of experience. When he encounters teammates with less experience, he readily shares his experiences and gives the story or advice context to help the listener better understand.. Truman observed a teammate following a procedure incorrectly but unknowingly so. He went to the teammate and explained that there was an issue, and then went on to explain the correct way to follow the procedure while maintaining a calm and friendly demeanor.. Truman was tasked with leading an informational session for the team. He developed a plan for the educational lesson and proceeded to ask for input from the audience to help create a curriculum that better connects with the audience. The plan was executed flawlessly and the audience exited the session well informed.
. Truman Smith is a caring individual. He not only socializes with people just because they are a part of the group and trying to make them feel welcome, he actually tries to get to know the individual on a more personal level and build a stronger bond.. Truman Smith is one smart guy. He has taught me many things about the military that I don't think I would've learned while I was here. He's knowledgeable and tries to spread it to anyone willing to receive it.. Truman Smith is a good role model. He not only abides by the rules, applies good leadership tactics, and knows when it's okay to have fun, he portrays confidence and that allows others to feel confident in what they do.
. Encourages his team to strive for excellence. Example: encourages his team to maintain military bearing at all times and to always do what's right.. Has good follower-ship skills. Example: during leadership events he ensures his critical thoughts are shared and is active in group participation.. He is willing to step up when someone asks him to. Example: when our guidon bearer was unable to guide anymore he stepped up when asked without hesitation.",18

Needless to say, I was very nervous and Cadet Etcheson was able to calm my nerves and support me during the training. His positivity. You step up when you don't have to. You help people when you are not required to. You are good at keeping your emotions hidden, but you're genuinely good. You took in two children who were not biologically your own, but you made them yours. You provide for all five of your children, unwavering, without complaint. You are of remarkably sound mind.. Determination and constant strive to be better. You work hard. You always want to improve yourself and your situation. That is admirable on many levels. When WOCS didn't work out, you jumped head-first into finishing your Bachelor's degree, starting your Master's, and finding a great job. When you had the chance to enter Officer School, you jumped into it. You did what needed to be done, and you did it quickly. Because you always want to improve. You always want to take in new experiences.. You are level-headed. You have a strong presence. And yet you are approachable. You have every quality needed in a leader. You are good at taking charge, teaching, showing the way. You can be stern while also understanding. These qualities are what will make you a good officer, a good teacher, instructor, and have made you a good father. You're focused, confident, and patient in almost every situation.. Etcheson is always willing to help out members of the flight whether it is driving us to the BX or being someone to listen.. He is incredibly competent. Anytime we have a group assignment he always has amazing ideas.. He is always motivating people to do better.. Alex will be faced with many dynamic transitions. Observing the cultures/value differences or Army and Air. The transition from enlisted to officer. The technical challenges of Cyber require a tactical understanding, and the leadership challenges require strategic interpersonal understanding. Both of them can be more of an art than a science.. Alex possesses incredible humility. He is amazing talented and doesn't let it go to his head.. Alex is always available to assist his peers. He will stop what he is doing to make sure a problem is addressed.. Alex always sees all sides of an issue, not simply his personal opinion. He is non-biased and is always will to see both sides of the coin.. Alex, you are your best when you lead by example. When preparing for OTS, you assessed and adjusted your health and fitness to match the necessary physical requirements. While doing so, another airman in the shop was also looking to transform his diet and ultimately his lifestyle. You took notice, and coordinated on a program you could both do to achieve your goals. This ended up being the ketosis diet, which when just starting out can be extreme and very hard to accomplish on your own. Regardless, you both started the journey. As someone looking from the outside in, the diet looked limiting and difficult. It was the same with the airman you started it with, Velazquez You kept him accountable, and showed through example that it could be done, and is worth the effort and sacrifice. With that extra push, both you and Velazquez were able to achieve your goals and undergo a transformation for your own betterment. Sometimes people need that little push to help keep them going, and it’s people like you who are willing to help give that final push and get them to reach their full potential.. Alex, you are at your best when you’re brave. One specific event that comes to mind when you were brave is some time back when we first met. We were at Sgt.Osment’s house and everything was going great. You suddenly get a call that your wife is back home and there is a man outside harassing her. Without hesitation, you asked me to come alongside with you to aid the situation and ultimately help your wife out. I agreed, and we went. Upon arrival, we found that the man had left. Regardless of whether the man was there or not, what I admired from the situation was your willingness to drop everything and help someone in need of it. Without hesitation, you took action to neutralize the situation, especially to help someone you care about. Knowing you, I know you would have done the same for any other personas well...it’s that kind of bravery that goes far not only to the person in need...but it ultimately makes the world a better place.. Alex, you are at your best when you are selfless. I specifically recall an event where you displayed such a characteristic. During the infrastructure upgrade of our building, things were hazy as far as figuring out where the pieces would fall together and how everything was going to work. All the meanwhile, you were forced to juggle out-processing and preparing your personal and professional life for the departure to OTS. Despite all the turmoil, you managed to put together a baseline configuration for our devices. A tremendous help to the team left to pursue the upgrade without their top network technician...it was an act of selflessness and professionalism. Seeing you stay committed to excelling at work until the very day you left really struck a note with me. Too often I see people struck with the “senioritis” of transitioning to other things. You’ve shown me to practice putting the needs of others in front of your own for the greater good of the team.. Alex you are a great person and always help when asked.. You helped me so much with the computer stuff in the beginning of tfot. I didn't even know how to save a file properly. Thank you. Also thank you for allowing me to use your cac reader. without that I would have never gotten paid or been able to use Microsoft office. Alex the family man: To me Alex stepping up to the plate and taking care of not only his biological children, but his step children as well is a huge strength I see in Al. He's a good father and in turn those skills will make him a great leader.. When Alex decided he wanted to join the Army. Not only did he complete his service honorably, but he's so passionate that he decided to join the Air Force as well years down the road. When Alex is dedicated and has his mind set he will achieve whatever it is he wants.. A huge strength of Alex is how smart he is. Me personally, I struggle academically, but Alex on the other hand picks up anything you teach him quick and is book smart.",20

Tim walked his airmen thru the whole process from finding a house to finalizing. He went out of his way to provide feedback on potential properties and interest rates. Even while Tim was sent on temporary assignment to another base he made sure that he was kept up to date on any developments. In the end his troop was not only able to get a great house but got it at a fantastic price. A large part of that success was due to Tim’s guidance.. While Tim was going to Intelligence school some of his classmates were having trouble keeping up with the learning. Tim took time each day to help them understand the material. When students continued to struggle he set time aside every night to go and tutor his classmates. By the end of the 6 month school Tim's dedication to his classmates’ success saw that no one failed a block of instruction.. When Tim’s shop was struggling to pass physical fitness tests he took it upon himself to take charge of the situation and fix it. He created a compressive program to correct an individual’s physical performance. The program not only forced the individual to workout but provided mentorship on diet choices and looked for any underlying causes such as depression. Since the programs implantation his shop has had a 100% pass rate.
. Timothy McGee is a self-directed and self-motivated individual, who, through his drive and attention to detail, has given our organization the framework to succeed in our new mission. By allowing him the space and discretion to create an entirely new program, and by recognizing that his knowledge and experience give him insights that might otherwise not be captured, we have been able to train our members to be ready to succeed well before our go date.
. I have had the pleasure of working with Tim McGee for just about a year. Coming into a new unit is not always easy, but it is especially not easy when the unit you are coming to is under huge changes and is getting ready to stand-up after a 3 year down period. Tim was in the Intel training shop and I quickly came to realize how much of an asset he is/was to our team. His job was to build a training program from start to finish without any real guidance or direction. Not only did he successfully do this, but he developed a program that would rival any program that has been in operation for years. A program that others want to use as their own and mimic for their operations. On top of that he did all of this while learning the Air Force ways rather than Army ways. His determination and persistence ended up turning our training program into a world class act.. Tim McGee has not only been instrumental to our team with the creation of the training program but also by standing up a physical training (PT) program to help those he works with get better with their own training and overcome their struggles. He developed a training program on his off time and ensured that there was someone available on all three shifts to help his co-workers PT and get ready for their tests. He also volunteered to lead these sessions during Drill weekends. On top of that other shops saw what he was doing and asked him to help stand-up their own to help some of their members who were struggling on that front.. Finally, Tim has also stood up when it comes to team morale events. He has ensured that we integrated new members into the shop and has asked to start quarterly morale events to keep our team close and to help the burn out rate that comes with24/7 mission operations. He is the epitome of what an officer should be and is going to be a first class addition to my Intel Officer Team!
. Tim, you are the best father and husband that I could ever ask for. Your family is your number one priority and your commitment to us shines through in all aspects of your life. While you are gone for work related jobs you always make it a point to check in with us and find ways to make our life better or easier. When you are home, you find ways to work your schedule to allow for the most time with your family, and if you end up on a strange shift you make sure that the time you do have with us is well spent. After a long time apart, you always make a point to plan something to reunite us – from Dubai to Great Wolf – you always make sure that we are brought back together and quickly creating family memories again. When Flynn died, instead of us drifting apart you worked to keep us together, and I will never forget that. I have never doubted your commitment to our family, but the way you continually pulled me back from the ledge and reminded me that we always have each other, even when you were on the ledge yourself, solidified that commitment.. One of your strengths is that you are always looking for a way to better someone else's life. An example of this is how you are frequently pushing your colleagues to complete the requirements for a promotion. You see that there is a lot of value added there, frequently without too much effort required. You are there to encourage them and push them, even if that means a conversation outside of typical work hours, or the occasional hassling of a spouse. Another example of this is you are always quick to help out when a colleague needs help due to life choices. Sometimes this means you help someone move, and sometimes it means you provide money to a family having a tough time. You may say you don’t like people, but you make sure that those you care about are taken care of.. You are at your best when you understand the true purpose behind what you are doing. You understand that your time is valuable and have no interest in wasting it when you could be accomplishing a mission or task. This makes you a good leader because you don’t waste other people’s time forcing them to accomplish busy work simply for the sake of keeping them busy. You recognize that everyone is getting pulled in many directions and time is valuable.
. When I was having trouble with the-name-we-do-not-speak, I could whine to you about it without fear that you would repeat anything I said. Not only that, you would commiserate with me and share your own misery. It made me feel like you not only understood what I was dealing with, but you were going through it with me, which honestly helped me a lot to get through the day to day BS. That way of relating was very much appreciated.. When I needed a place to go in TX, you were quick to step in and give me a place to live. When I detailed information about myself that no one else knew, you kept it to yourself (except that one time you were drunk, but that was okay) and didn’t treat me any differently, at least in any negative way. Once you were okay with that, I started letting myself be a little more myself around you and was relieved to find that I'm not the only one going to Hell. And while we’re on the topic of Hell, you telling me you'd meet me on the bus when I told you my dad’s poor reaction actually made that shitty situation a little better. I’ve always appreciated your loyalty.. I remember that day I enlisted and I really wanted a husband to be there and you were there for me. Even if you weren’t MY husband. I got to be a depend a for about10 seconds. That was nice. For real, though, whenever I ask you to do something you’re there. You’re one of the few friends who invite me over on a regular basis (even though my schedule always seems to work against it, we’ll correct that when you get back). You give me honest feedback and ask for the same. There have been a couple times that I criticized things you were working on (I tried to be nice about it, but sugarcoating isn’t my strong point) and you got what I was saying without holding my poor manners against me. When I was working on losing weight and getting back in shape, you were again there to commiserate with me. You are supportive, in a dickish way that makes it not weird. So thanks, or something.",13

One day my husband Kevin, who is an avid cyclist, asked him if he would like to join him on a ride. Preston had not been riding a bike on any length for quite some time, if ever. However, he loved physical activities, working out, and a challenge so he took my husband up. After all, how hard can it be? Preston was in shape and he was going out for a ride with a fifty-something year old. What he didn't know going into the ride was how far the ride was going to be, the pace Kevin usually rides, the impact of the heat of the day, and the number of hills along the ride. They took off with smiles on their faces and set a quick pace down the drive and never slowed down. If you’ve ever rode for any distance, you know that it doesn’t take long for the legs to feel it and if you’re not used to having your seat on the seat for that long, it can be quite challenging to the body in that area as well, if you know what I mean. Despite the heat, the muscle fatigue, and the endurance required in this new sporting outing, Preston never lagged behind, never complained, and never made excuses- all 66 miles of it! He dug deep and gave his typical “all-out” effort to not only perform at his best, but to do so in a manner in order to keep up with an experienced rider so that Kevin could have the training ride intended for the day. Despite the sore muscles and various other body parts, Preston arrived back at the house with such a smile on his face and jovial attitude, you would have never known of the great lengths it took to conquer this, his first true long distance endurance ride. I’m not sure how many he has gone on since, but this was one full of memories to cherish for a lifetime. Preston Neumann- “ Preparedness to Serve and Lead ""In my opinion, Preston has always been a hard worker, willing to do what it took to be responsible, set an example, get the job done, and /or to set and reach goals. He had the goal of getting into the Air Force. For him this meant, among other things, for him to go through rigorous physical training. It was not enough for him to accomplish the training, but to give it his best in order to achieve new “bests” along the way. Often this meant challenging himself physically to the point of near absolute exhaustion, in order to better prepare himself for future challenges. In addition to getting ready for the physical riggers, he delved into research to know more about the military, the Air Force, and various roles & jobs within it specifically so he would be mentally prepared as much as possible for the coming career. Meanwhile, he was a faithful, dependable, hardworking employee that was engaging and liked by both fellow employees and clients. No job was too small, menial, or out of his comfort zone when new skills had to be learned to do the required tasks. He was and is someone I know I could count on to lead skillfully, intelligently, dependably, and with a great attitude and demeanor that makes for a great environment for others to work alongside or under.
. In 2012, Preston and I joined with six other people to complete the Tough Mudder. This mud run was a 13 mile race with 28 obstacles that was geared around team camaraderie. Our group consisted of mostly employees and friends that we worked with at a small, family-owned, health and fitness club named Benessere Active. He was inspirational in his dedicated training and involved the team in ensuring we were all prepared for the task to come. On the day of the race, he had body paint that showed his love for Christ that pumped up the team and we all prayed before the beginning of the run. Throughout the race he had a tremendous amount of energy and kept it fun for the group. He made sure to encourage everyone through each obstacle and offer praise. We were all there for one another, but I knew for sure that I could count on Preston to help me complete obstacle before me. After our race, we all celebrated and he continued to participate in the pull up challenge and encourage the next wave of participants. I feel very blessed to have shared that experience with Preston by my side.. Preston has a deep love for his family that pours into the lives of others. For the time we had spent together, I felt like a sister in Christ with him. We often spent time in group gatherings over a thanksgiving meal, church event, or playing some sort of sport. I would consider one of Preston's strengths to be an ""include."" He was always sure to invite me to ultimate Frisbee, fun running events around town, and conversation with people I wasn't quite familiar with. Preston always had a lot of friends because of his genuine desire to include others and encourage them to pursue their goals.. Overall, I would consider Preston to be a great teacher. I have witnessed him be really patient through individual's progress and understanding in the fitness industry. He is an encourager when people make small goals by running longer distances, or when people are hard on themselves for barely missing the mark. Preston is diverse with his interactions with individuals across all generations. I have seen him connect with elders and children on a deeper level, as well as, continue that growth in the relationship. He is respectful of others' differences and seeks to understand those different perspectives.
. COMPETITIVE & STRATEGIC Preston is a competitive individual and is at his best when he’s challenged; mano amano, you vs him, the world vs him. He was raised to take the hand he was dealt and annihilate the competition. He does not lack grace and mercy, but in a competition, he is relentless until the end. Life is a game of chess and Preston is the best chess player I know. He knows he can win, succeed, persevere. If you think he’s losing because of his body language or something he says, likely this is part of his strategy to make it seem you have the upper hand, right before he takes your king. He is multiple steps ahead of the average joe and isn’t afraid to challenge the best.. HARD WORKING In the past few years, Preston has joined the Air Force, finished is under graduate studies, and continued his education to complete an MBA (Master of Business Administration). Shortly after, and most recently, he was accepted into OTS (Officer Training School) for the Air Force and will train to become a CSO (Combat Systems Officer), which is one of the most favored and sought after positions in the Air Force. This is only the beginning, as Preston aspires to do great things in the Air Force and when he gets out and becomes a civilian again. His hard work and will continue to pay off and bring him far in his career.. LOVING Preston is the best brother anyone could ask for. Being an identical twin, I never got to experience friendships like normal kids because Preston was always there, and always my best friend. We played catch, watched movies, got into trouble. We fought toll the time and couldn’t do anything without making it a competition, but in the end, he was and still is a loving brother. He also loves our two younger brothers, whom have always looked up to him. Now, Preston is married to a beautiful bride, and they are expecting their first baby -a little boy. I know he will continue to love and cherish both of them forever and always.
. Preston is a very determined and driven individual. When he sets goals, he always works very hard to accomplish them. One time in particular in which these strengths were evident, was when he decided to obtain his Master’s degree. After deciding that he would pursue further education, Preston began working toward this goal right away. He worked full-time, was involved in many other extracurricular activities, coached CrossFit classes, and continued to dedicate time to his family all while taking classes full-time. After just a year and a half, he had earned a MBA because of his drive, determination, and hard work.. One of Preston’s greatest strengths is his patience. I have now known Preston for four and a half years, and I have rarely seen him lose his patience. He continues to be patient even when others constantly test his patience. Once, Preston explained something to me several times to ensure that I understood what he was saying. He did not lose his patience once, despite me asking numerous questions.. Another of Preston’s strengths is his willingness to help others succeed. Since I have known Preston, I’ve witnessed him acting as a mentor to a handful of younger guys. Preston also challenges others to strive to be the best that they can be. One example of this is Preston coaching CrossFit classes and leading a running group on base to help others meet their physical fitness goals. If anyone needed help in this area, they knew that they could ask Preston for help and he would gladly oblige. His actions and willingness to help others let them know that he cares and wants the best for others.
. Preston Thomas Neumann entered into this world, July 19, 1988, weighing in at5lbs;11oz; 18 inches long. That would normally seem small for a baby, but he had to share the womb with his identical twin brother, Bradford. Preston is the first born of four boys! He is a natural born leader with many God given, wonderful characteristics and skills. It's no surprise to me any achievements he has ever accomplished, as he has always had that competitive edge about him. From the time he was a toddler, everything on him or about him had to be perfect. He had to have his shirt tucked in at 18 months. His twin brother had no such concerns about being neat or thing shaving to be just right! By the age of two, he could color perfectly between the lines. In grade school, his teacher would tell me that almost on a daily basis, Preston would stay in from recess to redo his work. If he made one single error, he would throw it in the trash and start over. Preston always said school was so easy, continuously making all A's and taking accelerated classes as if it were no challenge for him. He learned how to read by age three and many times I would find him tucked away, snuggled up, reading a book. I believe he read almost every book in the library, and at a much higher reading level than his age group. Preston was my easiest child. He was able to maintain enormous self control in any situation, including getting into major fist fights with his twin. His twin always thought he had the upper hand on Preston, but, the truth of the matter is, Preston had so much self control not to retaliate against his brother. To this day, Preston remains the calm personality. If strife comes to him or around him, he calmly sails through it, being the peacemaker, in order to resolve any situation. Preston is a humble man and is able to quickly admit to any wrong doings. He is nonjudgmental and quick to forgive. Preston is also very athletic, I believe from when he was in the womb. When he was barely walking, at nine months mind you, he had excellent eye-hand coordination. He could bounce a ball off a bat continuously without the ball dropping, or hit the ball far distances. He played soccer at age five and was quick to get to the ball and kick it right on spot. Preston played every sport available throughout his school years and succeeded in all of them. I believe the toughest form of athletics I've ever watched Preston do, was the ""Mudrudder""! We drove at 3am to get to the competition site. I was even more amazed and in total awe of his athletic endurance and perseverance. I could not understand why he would put his body through such torture, but he saw it as an honor and challenge to compete, and that he did! Preston has always made me feel so proud to be his ""mama"", and I consider myself very blessed to call him my son!
. Even though, I am so very proud of Preston's brains and bronze, I may be even more proud of how kind and sweet he has always been. He has been nothing but pure delight to me and others throughout his life. There is one major trait that sets him apart from his three brothers, and that is his genuine loving-kindness. All of my boys have some sarcasm in them, but Preston doesn't expand with that on the same level. From the time he was a very young boy, I could ask him to do a chore or act of kindness and he would ALWAYS say, ""NO PROBLEM MOM"". I didn't get the back talk, rolling of eyes or sighs. I could always count on him to complete any task without having to follow-up to see what kind of job he did. One of many of my favorite characteristics about Preston, is how he literally shows me and tells me how much he loves me. On every special occasion, no matter where he is in the world or how busy he is, he will send me a beautiful card with the most loving words written by him in it. I've always told him I didn't care about material things or presents. However, I have received some amazing gifts from him as well. For example, he had a dozen roses delivered to me via Fed-Ex, while he was stationed in Japan. WOW! His other gifts have been very personal as well, such as a jar of sand from Okinawa, special treats picked out from his travels and so forth. I keep all of his cards he has ever given tome in a special box. When I'm feeling blue, I know I can open that box, start reading those beautiful words he wrote from his own heart and become immediately uplifted. Another favorite pastime is our long conversations. When Preston and I get the chance to talk, mostly on the phone, because of our different schedules and living many miles apart, we will talk for hours about everything under the sun. I cherish those talks, even in the middle of the night. It's always such a joy to hear his voice and actually see him. Thank God for Hangouts! It has gotten me through him living on the other side of the world and not seeing him but once a year. Preston also gives the most wonderful HUGS! I cry every time he hugs me, because it is so genuine and it makes me feel very special. At age 29, he still calls me ""MAMA""! That will never get old and I hope he will always call me ""MAMA""!
. Another amazing strength of Preston's, is his impression upon others. He has always been a leader with very strong leadership skills, such as knowing right from wrong, taking charge of any situation, no matter the complexity, and his integrity. He has two brothers who are 10 and 12 years younger. When they were born, Preston's dad and I told him that he would need to set a good example for them, as they would lookup to him more than their own parents. That has turned out to be more true than ever imagined. Those two younger brothers really do look up to Preston and his achievements, along with all of his characteristics. On occasion, Preston will be engaged in stern conversations with either of them, not backing down from his strong values and morals. His little brothers don't always appreciate that, but in time, I believe they will reflect on Preston's encouraging words and guidance. With that being said, I will have to say that of all the fantastic traits, strengths and characteristics about Preston, my favorite has to be his morals and values, all wrapped up in his firm belief in God, and knowing Jesus Christ as his Savior. Preston stands on a firm foundation in his relationship with Christ. That means more to me personally than anything else about Preston. Nobody is perfect, but, Preston puts on the full armor of God and represents Him very well. Which leads me to the next amazing accomplishment of Preston. He proudly joined the Air Force, dreaming to be a pilot. Through different obstacles that occurred, Preston told me approximately a year ago that there would be a ""ONE IN A MILLION CHANCE"", that that would ever happen. My response was, ""SO YOU SAY YOU'VE GOT A CHANCE""? He sheepishly laughed and said, ""right"". Low and behold, it didn't completely happen, but he is now going to be a navigator, flying in planes, and COULD still be a pilot! Which, even if that doesn't happen, I consider that a HUGE accomplishment. In the very beginning of joining the Air Force, Preston discovered a diamond in a huge pile of dirt. That would be my precious daughter-in-law, Hope! He had actually known her for years, as they attended the same church growing up. I saw her as a very beautiful brown-eyed, sweet, kind and shy young lady. I always told Preston he would make an extraordinary husband. He began dating this small town, sweet girl and they quickly fell in love. He knew he was going to have to go far away from her small town to serve in the Air Force and it would take a miracle to get her to join him in marriage. Preston, the complete romantic, came up with this approximate seven day engagement trip, ranging from Texas, to San Francisco, to Reno, including helicopter rides, spa days, scenic driving, etc... and standing on a hilltop over the lake in Reno, presenting her with dog tags with the inscription, ""will you marry me"" and a beautiful diamond ring. He was praying she would say, yes, and she did! During that engagement trip, Preston received orders that he was going to Okinawa, Japan! After Hope accepted his proposal to marriage, Preston asked, ""So do you want to move to Japan""? That they did and had a wonderful journey, exploring so much beauty and time together, all while both of them working full-time and both earning their Master's degrees. Now, Preston is in Alabama for his OTS training and is graduating in August. From there, Preston and Hope will move to Pensacola, Florida and are expecting their first born, a son, in October. Preston could not do anything else to make me feel like the most blessed mama in the world! In fact, he has gone above and beyond anything I ever imagined! His lifetime of hard work and perseverance has definitely come to fruition. I could not be more proud of my son, Preston Thomas Neumann. I look forward to watching Preston and Hope's journeys completely fulfilled in the future.
. Story #1: Competitiveness Probably most of these stories, though focused on Preston, will include some passing or even involved reference to his twin brother Bradford. Since their birth, when Preston “came in (out actually!) first” place, he has been competing with his brother. He was literally positioned on top of and over much of Brad in utero, thereby eventually causing him distress late in their mom’s pregnancy and a slightly premature C-section delivery. Of course, it was stressful and so much to take in at the time, but it was indeed a rather strong precursor to their competitive nature that has endured and continued through childhood and into their adult lives. There are many examples of this, so I will highlight a few in this story. We should probably begin in little league baseball, where they were both playing at age 5 or 6, and involved in a select team around age 10-11. Preston was always challenging and pushing his brother, who could throw farther or hit the ball harder. And they were amazed and slightly crushed when their dad hit a ball farther than them in a Father/Son game – he immediately said that he would hit the ball that far also when he was an adult. It wasn’t a desire or dream so much as a statement of intent. This competitive bent also extended to schoolwork, where Preston was a Top 10student in his high school class – but not good enough as his brother was a few positions higher. More recently, just while back home in Texas during a holiday leave, this competition would heat up again – who could do a longer cross fit routine, or who could hit a golf ball farther. In this, they both still fall short of their dad – but Preston’s stated goal is that he will keep playing golf just so that he can out score and outdrive me on the golf course. It most likely will happen at some point, but the fact is that he looks at and sees how he can achieve and get better in some way. All because of that competitive drive to be the best at whatever he is doing.",16

The volunteer opportunity couldn't have gone better from my perspective. The challenge lied in setting it up and because you did so well in doing that, when it came time to execute, it went smooth. When you continue put forth your best effort despite what the task is at hand, you succeed.. Cadet Brown's leadership abilities have grown considerably since the beginning of this class.. Cadet Brown is always willing to help the flight or a fellow cadet when needed.. Cadet Brown is a friendly and a pleasure to be around. He does not complain and helps get the job done.. Cadet Brown was able to adapt to the military culture quickly and has been a positive member in our flight since day 1. You never hear him complain and he takes constructive feedback well.. You coordinated and executed the volunteer event very professionally. It was uncomplicated, but still with significant impact to the local community.. You conducted an outstanding briefing when compared to the first aircraft brief required early in the class. It was great that you made such progress. You have an apparent eagerness to learn and progress in the Air Force which will help you do well in your career.. I think you have come a long way since we first got here. You did a great job with the briefings and have shown to be capable of a lot more than you may give yourself credit for. When you were selected for some in-field leadership positions you did a great job taking the reins and leading the group. You are a fast learner as well and did very well academically. I think you picked up marching very fast as well. Much faster than I did. I think your strengths in academics plus your natural ability to lead are going to serve you well. Looking forward to being a CSO with you.. I got to learn more about Bryan when he was my partner when conducting combative exercises. During the exercise I discovered his desire to learn. I was the flight leader for the previous week and he had a feeling that he would be chosen real soon. He asked numerous questions because he wanted to be prepared to succeed if he was to be the upcoming flight leader.. Bryan may come off as an introvert but there many times I see him breaking that in order to interact with others. Just recently we an open peer review with our entire flight discussing everyone's strengths and weaknesses. Bryan was very interactive during the discussion which proved to me that he can be adaptable to situations even if its outside their comfort zone.. One of Bryan's largest strengths to me is his positive attitude. He never gives any negative vibes regardless of the situation. We are constantly in the heat and our schedule is continuously changing which creates a frustrating environment. Even in these circumstances Bryan always kept a positive attitude.",12

. Kelly is by far one of the happiest people I have ever met. She always has a smile and can bring a smile to another person. She always talks about her kids and enjoys the smallest things in life. She makes it impossible to be sad around her. She is a friend you want in your life and should keep in your life.. Kelly is able to share her troubles with people. She is very open and when she needs help, she comes to people. She doesn't lock herself up because she knows that will not help. She wants to open and she makes sure that she gets help.. Kelly is ready for whatever is given to her. She prepares for leadership opportunities ahead of time by asking questions and researching. She does her part and is ready for when those times come.
. Cadet Nunn’s biggest strength is her personality. She is always has a positive attitude but is also assertive when she has to be. Because of those strengths, people enjoy following her. For example, during her volunteer event at the Zoo, she stayed in command and had us all accomplish our tasks. People were also very happy regardless of working under the sun. She creates a comfortable environment with her positive attitude.
. Cadet Nunn has a very positive personality. She is always smiling and seems to genuinely enjoy life. This personality type is very contagious and easily spreads throughout an organization. This type of quality will help her as a leader because her subordinates are likely to enjoy working for her and it will greatly help with morale

. Cadet Nunn is a fun-loving spirit who keeps the flight smiling. She is willing to dance and have fun in any moment, even the tough ones. She is also able to remind the flight of the big picture perspective and keep us focused on the end goal of graduation verses the small frustration we may be going through.. Cadet Nunn is caring. She checks in on other flight members and notices the nuances to make sure they are ok and engaged in whatever activity.
. Kelly was able to coordinate a volunteer event fairly last minute after her initial plans fell through due to the course schedule. She was able to coordinate one that people enjoyed and wanted to do and which fit into the schedule. She reacted quickly to a changing situation and was still able to come up with an amenable option for her flight members.
. Kelly brings such joy and life to our flight with her personality. She is such a fun, energetic and excited person! She rarely seems uninterested in showing her support for a flight mate.. Kelly took over the role of community service officer with great drive. The coffee break that she encouraged the entire flight to go was wonderful. She knows exactly where to put her energy into her work.
. Cadet Nunn has outstanding leadership skills and exemplifies the willingness to take care of others on a daily basis. She has assisted our flight including me more times than I can count since the beginning of OTS. She will sit down and work with an individual until he or she understands the material through and through. She has also been an amazing wingman working with me on our community service events which both ended up being quite successful. Our flight wouldn't be the same without her.",18

Cadet Buning has a pleasant demeanor that is calm, cool, and collected.. Cadet Buning is clever like a fox.. Cadet Buning works hard and stands as one of the most solid members of our flight. He's going to go far with his approachable attitude and his strength of character.. Cadet Buning has among the calmest demeanors, regardless of the situation he is placed in. Case in point, he has performed superbly in his role at flight leader for our flight over the past week. His ability to relate to the rest of his flight while maintaining consistent order and discipline has been a welcome relief to our flight during officer training. Cadet Buning is very decisive in his decision making, which has boded well during his time as our flight leader, and will service him well on his journey to officer stardom in the Air Force.. If I had to sum up Cadet Buning, he is the ultimate consummate Airmen. Cadet Buning simply has that ""it"" factor that makes people want to be under his supervision. His leadership style is unwavering, but at the same time, relevant to get the mission completed.. Alan is a very knowledgeable and easy going individual, whom I have had the distinct pleasure of becoming friends with over the course of our training here at Maxwell. I see a friendship that will last well beyond our time here at Officer Training School.. You have an impressive ability to stay even keeled during all situations. I have never seen you waiver from the steady dedication you display.. You are always willing to help others. You stay aware of what is taking place around you and are always willing to offer assistance.. You were able to make impressive strides with Cadet Collins drill abilities during the week that she flight leaders.. You have consistently been on my top 3 list in the IMR. I have a lot of respect for you and here is why.#1: Empathetic - You appear to have a genuine interest in your people. You have helped myself and the other non-priors tremendously, especially early on with Marching. While some take a survival of the fittest mentality, you are a true team player in my opinion. You have taken the time to help people in our flight who have struggled at different points and either came to you for help or you've proactively helped them.. #2: Respectful - You give great on the spot corrections when you feel they are needed but most importantly you do it respectfully without sarcasm or without calling anyone out on their mistakes. You have taken them aside and helped them out.. #3: Competent - You know your stuff man. From marching, M9 shooting, your briefings and any questions people have asked you regarding AF life and procedures, you have been  doing a great job in my opinion. I think all these qualities will serve you well as you continue onto the next step in your AF career. Keep in touch after OTS. Cadet Buning always looks out for his fellow cadets. When a cadet was going through a mental hurdle and was emotionally distressed, he was the first to notice and tried to intervene by comforting her.. Cadet Buning shows service before self when he takes free time out of his day to help people who are weak in drill and ceremony get better. For example, when the flight was learning Open Ranks, he made sure the flight leader was clear on the procedures so that she would get a good grade from the MTIs when she was going to get graded.. Cadet Buning is a great communicator. When he was flight leader, he always made sure we all knew what was going on and always gave us run-downs of the next day or upcoming due dates via email and in person.",19

As with any one off project there were many obstacles but Jeff took the lead in finding solutions. His attention to detail was evident when it came time to implement the upgrades as there were very few problems and no showstoppers. We were tasked to test a Saturn 20 turbine and reduction gearbox but the turbine test berth had not been designed which would allow this type of equipment as it was driven from the front end of the unit vs the rear. Jeff lead the discussions of how we could do it, actions needed to get it done, and timeline to make sure customers needs were met. Again his leadership and attention to detail would be major contributing factors in getting this task accomplished under original budget and ahead of expected delivery date. What was more impressive was once we started the test is was completed within four hours, unheard of for this type of commissioning. I think the single most important factor in the outcome is that he would not accept anything less than doing something to the best of our ability, shortcuts were eliminated unless absolutely necessary and when they were necessary he ensured that risks were mitigated.. We had a fault in the PLC and since it showed that it was a hardware fault I was getting ready to spend a lot of money on replacing the hardware. Jeff took the lead and contacted the manufacturer and patiently worked through several issues over several hours and got the system back in operation before the next test. His actions prevented us from sending money on something we didn’t need and was able to get it done so there was no testing delays.
. Jeffery Din is outstanding when it comes to solving puzzles and riddles. He's one of the smartest in the class.
. Cadet Din's strength is in his intellect. Where most people with his intellect tend to be of a narcissist nature, Cadet Din does not flaunt his IQ in front of his peers. He does not succumb to the pressure of being placed in the spotlight in a military environment. During a most recent military inspection, he performed flawlessly.. Speaking in front of an audience comes naturally to Cadet Din. As evidenced by his near perfect scores on both of the briefings, his public speaking skills came to full view. You can tell he is very comfortable in public speaking situations.. Jeff's ability to take on leadership roles has been quite an easy task for him. Knowing that he will be in this flight leader position for the next two weeks, Jeff has taken an optimistic approach to leading us as a flight. He is orderly, prepared, and a very good communicator of upcoming plans and details.
. You have an obviously high intellect which puts you in a position to always constructively contribute to conversations.. You didn't think twice about taking me with you to get our hair cut the first day we were at OTS. I appreciated the willingness to help despite not knowing me. You presented a well put together depiction of the F-22 that was interesting to listen to.
. I think you will do really well at UPT. You seem to grasp concepts very quickly and you should pride yourself in your academic ability. You really take the time to think through situations before providing your feedback in class and every time you speak in class you always provide thoughtful input. I think academics is your strong suit and will continue to serve you well.
. Jeff gave a safety presentation to the test facility about the dangers of high voltage. He understood that everyone was not familiar with how the principles of electricity work, so he broke the concepts down to easily relatable real world examples like water flowing out of a tank. He then took it a step further and demonstrated how high voltage could affect people differently based on body chemistry. His presentation was very well laid out to convey the importance of having the correct equipment in place when dealing with high voltage electricity and his speech during the presentation was impeccable. Jeff was the project manager of our recent control & vibration system upgrade in our test facility. Being an upgrade, we had many faults in the current system to address, so he highlighted these issues as main points. He brought the test team together to obtain input on other features we would like to see in both the control and vibration system going forward. He met with many vendors and effectively eliminated the short comers to get us the best possible system for a great value. During and after the system commissioning, he stayed in contact with the chosen company to fix minor bugs or things we had not thought of during the initial planning stages and had the company place these items in. He was a great point of contact with the company and had these items completed in a very timely manner. Without Jeff, I do not think we would have ended up with this good of a system.. Jeff comes from a strong mechanical engineering background.

He was always a good student but there was a particular time where he outdid himself and impressed me beyond imagining. During our third year, a very difficult academic year because of all the specialty classes, Argenis received a call one day at about three in the morning (we were studying for a nasty mid-term), it was his stepmother, saying that his father had disappeared. Argenis reacted quickly and made his way back to his hometown, Arecibo, several miles away from our college. He managed to find his dad around eight in the morning, took him home and then he made his way back to Mayaguez (the town were our college was). I remember it like it was yesterday, hear rived, ate, took a shower and went to take the mid-term and then he got back on his car and drove back to his dad. Oh and the nasty mid-term which he studied almost nothing for, he aced it. That is my highest moment for Argenis, because what happened to his dad wasn’t something everyone can just, shake off, but he managed and on top of that he didn’t fail to take his test, to me that’s perseverance.. This story is just me recognizing that my friend gets the job done. It was our fifth college year and Argenis decided he was starting to work out and he told me: by December (it was July at the time) I’m going to have 3% body fat. I just looked at him and laughed at his face. But he proved me wrong, he stopped hanging out, no junk food, I thing he didn’t even go on dates. But come December he had done it, just 3%body fat and he liked it so much that he never stopped working out.. My last story is about the time I met Argenis. A mutual friend had a party for his birthday, it was our first year of college. I asked him who was going to be there and he mentioned a few people but he emphasized on a guy named Argenis. According to him Argenis, had just broken up with his girlfriend, had a bad semester and had a death in the family. I expected him to be wreck but when the doors opened, Argenis was the soul of the party. He had this amazing ability to shake off all the bad stuff and just concentrate in what he needed to do and have a good time. It was then and there that I decided: this guy would make a great friend. After 11 years of friendship, this guy has helped me study, party, meet women, buy rare comics, etc. He is still the soul of the party. So a few years back me Argenis and another friend let’s call him “Bob” of ours went to a mutual friends birthday party at a local bar/restaurant. As the night went on we all hung out had some drinks etc.. Bob however over did it quite a bit, we had never seen him in such a state. Thing is Bob got very belligerent not only to everybody at the party but especially to Argenis. He seemed to want to fight and basically cussed him (Argenis) out. A lesser person would have in all likelihood have either knocked this guy out or at the very least just leave and avoid the situation all together. Argenis however not only calmed down the entire situation but took “Bob” home and made sure he was ok. He showed great composure and reliability.. Argenis was a boy scout personally I never joined them, however they did plenty of stuff in and around our school. Once they had this whole thing planned out to restore a local children’s foster home and shelter. Argenis convinced me to help out even if I wasn't in any Boy Scout troop and then to my surprise he was the point man for the entire thing. I honestly don’t know if he was put in that position or not but regardless that whole thing took direction from him. He showed great overall leadership.. Argenis and I studied together since the second grade. Our school however upon reaching ninth grade splits people into advance and regular classes. Argenis went onto the advanced math course. Lots of people who went on to advance had no time for anything but study for those tests. I was in the regular math course and I was never a great mathematician so a few times during the year I struggled.

He scores high on tests and does well in other subjects. . Adam helps his friends a lot. When he sees someone struggling he tries to give them a hand without making them feel like he is a know it all. . Adam pays attention to the details. He is able to read into things well, and pick out what he needs to do very well. . Adam has always been an incredible role model for me. I followed in his footsteps and went to the same university that he did, but he was a junior when I was a freshman. The first few months were tough for me as I was learning how to adapt to the college lifestyle and making new friends. Adam was always there for me during that time, making sure I was ok and helping me in any way that he could. He really went out of his way to make sure I was enjoying myself even if it was at the expense of his free time. That is the kind of person and leader that I think Adam is: he is constantly willing to go out of his way to make sure that everyone else around him is comfortable and happy. . One story that always comes to mind is when I was golfing with Adam, our other brother Justin, and my dad. We were all playing miserably and getting progressively more upset with each other. Generally we have a great time on the golf course, but you could tell we were all angry at how bad we were playing and getting angrier and angrier at each other. Adam, as always, kept a positive attitude and spent his time making jokes and trying to get us all to enjoy the time that we were spending with each other. A few holes later, Adam had us all laughing and really enjoying the quality time that we had with each other. Adam will always see the bigger picture in things, and realize when people are making a bigger deal about things than they should be. He also will constantly work to make sure that everyone he is with/working with is happy and doesn’t have any issues or problems with anything. . Adam has always led by example for me. He may not always be the loudest or most talkative person in the room, but if I am ever lost I will just look to him to lead the way. Being the youngest sibling, I was always looking up to him for everything I did and I knew that if I could emulate him, then I would be OK. He has an outstanding moral compass and whenever I am lost I will always look to him to be leading by example. . Adam has always had a very quiet confidence about him that I find inspiring. Even when others did not believe he could accomplish a goal Adam was always sure that he could and never afraid to give it a try. In high school he joined the Crew team despite having no prior experience in rowing and quickly became one of the best Coxswains on the team. After winning an “ERG” competition among other Coxswains from other high school teams Adam then moved on to a rowing position on the team which culminated in his boat reaching the high school national championships his Junior year. When our family began boating Adam was the first to figure out how to wakeboard and then even the much more difficult skill of single-ski waterskiing which his brothers were unable to do or even try. Adam volunteered at the assisted living / nursing home where his grandparents lived at the end of their lives. There he provided a great service to these residents and his quiet confidence would give the residents confidence that they could try new activities. And most importantly Adam’s confidence in himself allowed him to follow his dream of being a pilot in the Air Force and has led him to Officer Training School . From a very early age Adam has been very resourceful and had an ability to figure things out. As a young boy he spent countless hours working with his Legos and even figured out how to utilize Lego robotics and engines. Adam could assemble and disassemble things without relying on instructions and just had a knack for how things were put together and how they worked. These skills led him to a degree in Mechanical Engineering in College which was a perfect fit for Adam and his skills and interests and will serve him well throughout his life. . I have always been very impressed with Adam and his willingness to take risks and displays no fears which ties in with his internal confidence skill. In high school he participated in a weeklong mission trip serving families in rural Appalachia doing home repairs in a very foreign environment to what he was used to growing up. In college Adam signed up for and participated in a 3 week intensive Engineering course in mainland China and was able to handle the travel and foreign culture with no issues. And most impressively Adam spent the entire summer after his Junior year in College doing mission work in a small village in Cameroon as part of the University of Dayton’s “Ethos” engineering program. Adam was literally on the other side of the world in a village of 100 people from Cameroon doing surveying work for a critical road around the large village lake. Adam did an amazing job handling this extreme situation and learning about the Cameroonian culture while helping the local people. We were very proud of how Adam handled this situation and especially of the service work he did. . When Adam and I were in 7th or 8th grade, we went to a week-long summer camp about an hour from our house. The first night, in an effort to get over the ""get to know you"" awkwardness of camp, the counselors devised a little icebreaker. We all broke into teams, and had to design, pitch, and present a product. Adam has always been incredibly mechanically gifted, and has a knack for creating cool and functional things. For the ice breaker, Adam created some kind of ""sweeper"" out of basic recycled goods (cardboard, plastic bottles, etc.) Not only did it work, but Adam got up and presented the product using the voice of Billy Mays. I was always impressed with how Adam was able to work mechanically, but I was especially proud looking back on this memory, because of the confidence he showed in presenting and backing up his design. . This isn't so much a story as what Adam did in high school. While looking for something new to do as a freshman, Adam and some friends joined the crew team. Being on the smaller side, Adam was identified as being more suited as a coxswain (yelling commands, not rowing). This was an important role, and Adam developed leadership skills in it. However, he decided that he wasn't content as just a coxswain, and devoted his junior and senior years to working out, getting stronger, and earning a spot as a rower in one of the boats. His hard work and discipline paid off, and Adam was able to enjoy two seasons rowing. . The biggest strength that I think Adam has is his openness to new things and new experiences. The perfect example of this is last summer, when Adam went on a 3 month Engineers without Borders trip to Cameroon. Adam went into a country with virtually no contacts on the ground, and only 1 other guy his age. Adam thrived in this new environment, providing valuable expertise to help a remote village plan a road to connect themselves with busier highways. To me, this example really illustrated that Adam is the kind of person who handles adversity and stressful situations well, and is able to adapt and change as needed to make the situation a success. . One of your strengths is that you set high goals, develop a game plan, and then work really hard to achieve them. In addition to the obvious example of being admitted into the Office Training School Pilot Program :-) there are many other more subtle examples.....You worked really hard to get in shape to qualify for the Varsity Men's Four crew boat....RJ saw your effort at practice, how you took your commitment to the team seriously, and selected you for that spot. You also worked really hard to place FIRST in an indoor rowing competition that was crazy-stiff competition!! As you were growing up, there were early signs of this strength when you would put your mind to something, even if it was building a lean-to fort at Canaan Valley, riding your bike for long explores around USC, or finishing a super complex Lego structure that included a LOT of engineering (I'm not an engineer, but I could spot your mechanical bent the way you played since you were 18 months old!) In first grade when we worked together to build a ""model"" of our house, you had very specific ideas about how you wanted to build the house and add all the details about our trees, gardens, front porch and pet....you never went for the quick and dirty approach, but always asked ""how can I make this better?"" to be sure you gave your best. When you wanted to water ski, you were never discouraged as you were learning how to ""get up"" nor were you discouraged when you could only stay up for a few minutes......you practiced and kept getting up, getting better, pushing yourself to new heights until you became awesome at jumping in/out of the wake! You had fun and embraced those early challenges as you knew it was a way for you to reach your goal....same exact examples when you pushed yourself to learn how to ride your bike or snow ski. You never shied away from difficult hurdles if it meant achieving your dreams --- we've seen this over and over and are sure this strength will serve you well as you progress through your Air Force career. These stories provide proof and confirm that your determination, work ethic, and intelligence support your desire to AIM HIGH - the SKY IS THE LIMIT!! . You are a very creative problem solver, and believe me, I relied upon that many times as you were growing up!! I remember once when a bicycle we purchased came in a million little pieces that were spread all over the kitchen floor. The diagram looked like a bowl of spaghetti but you dove right in, and in the blink of an eye, that bicycle was built completely from scratch! I could not believe it, you could not have been more than 10 or 11 at the time! More than once, you've helped us figure out different ways to move too-big furniture around tiny corners, or through doorways that were too small for the piece, and were a critical crew member when helping Dad address our many boat engine issues over the years. You solved many a wood-shop dilemma to produce a number of beautiful projects that we still enjoy in our home. You identified a novel way to address a practical commercial / business issue on your college project (dishwasher water temperature problem) which required a lot of creative problem solving! And although not your favorite problem to solve, you found ways to address Mark's business problems during your time in St. Pete at GE. All those years of building Legos -- go ahead and laugh-- but I am convinced you taught yourself creative problem solving as you continued to build more and more complex structures such as an elevator, an aircraft carrier, passenger jet liner, and the like. Just as in Legos, there are many times in real life when you can't find the ""right piece"" to solve the puzzle.....but over and over again, you have demonstrated that all problems can be solved with a little bit of thinking outside the box -- finding a different ""piece"" that works by adjusting the design. You will be called upon to share your skills in creative problem solving by helping others to appreciate there is always more than one way to solve a problem! . You are an optimistic, independent thinker and do not succumb to ""group think"" or negative peer pressure. You are the ""captain of your soul"" and feel comfortable driving the ship! You are a loyal friend, son, brother, cousin, nephew and grandson and often elicit input, but after you consider all points of view, you listen to your own inner voice about important decisions and the direction of your life. You do not let others -- or social ""norms"" -- overly-influence your decisions or goals. Your choices to be involved in (and contribute to) Children's Liturgy, Asbury Activities Volunteer, Cub Scouts, Calvary Camp, Crew Team, Appalachian Mission Trip, Shanghai Study Abroad, GE Internships, Cameroon Project -- all were examples where you chose unique paths different than the majority of your peers! I hope you will agree that each of these discrete ""independent thinker"" experiences have favorably impacted your development - adding texture to the fabric of your person - by providing opportunities for you to face and conquer new challenges, and to learn and grow from each experience (not just from your successes.) Your optimism, independence, and ability to embrace new and different opportunities will serve you well as you find yourself in many new and adventure-filled experiences in this new chapter of your life. It is an honor to be your Mom and to watch you blossom into the man you are :-) xo . Resilient- was diagnosed with Mono, and two days later he was back to contributing and doing anything he was able to do to help . Endurance-goes strong all the way through a task . Smart-always willing to sit down with you and share his knowledge ",18

Without being asked, she is willing to help anybody and everybody if she sees that opportunity. Furthermore, she is very organized. The whole flight is able to remain informed due to her initiative.
. Where does one begin with Cadet Steppe? A better question is, when referencing here positive contributions to FLT 1-17, where does one stop? Cadet Steppe, from day one, has tirelessly contributed to flight morale, flawlessly striven to assist anyone who is struggling, and constantly motivates those ""down in the dumps"". She delivers criticism perfectly, and in such a way where it is almost always received smoothly. Without a doubt, FLT 1-17 would not be performing at the level that it is without her contributions.
. In the last month, I've noticed two very prominent strengths of Holynne. First, her level headed organization skills are second to none in the flight. She is undoubtedly the backbone of our little group. She acts as the hub of information and everyone looks to her. Secondly, she has a heart for service. Outside of work, she cares for and mentors her kids... which I don't believe she shares any legal or blood relation or responsibility for. Still, her concern for them is evident and is awesome. I wasn't surprised to learn that she has done humanitarian work. That simply fits with the kind of giving person she is. I can't wait to see what she does as an officer in the AF
. Holynne is a driven person. She looks for the best way to accomplish a task and make the task easier. Constantly uploading useful information to shared sources and critiquing others work. She does all of this without being asked and lets everyone know once something is done.. Holynne is a very inspiring person. She makes you want to do better and be your absolute best. That attitude is great to have around when we are struggling with an assignment or preparing for a big event.. Holynne is a very caring person. She was in charge of many kids before coming to OTS but, has remained in contact with them. She emails them and checks on them almost everyday. She has since made plans for them and plans to pick up right where she left off in regards to being in there life.
. Cadet Steppe, in my opinion, brings a lot of knowledge and experience. Throughout the OTS program, me and other cadets, have been able to rely on her with questions about the military life and operations. One time, we went to the Golf course restaurant for lunch and she gave me a lot of useful information about my afsc. Besides her knowledge and experience, she is always willing to help others. Always having a positive attitude about things.
. Cadet Steppe has shown her leadership abilities by not being afraid to speak up in class. She shares her opinions and is willing to help others who are struggling. As a leader this will help her to speak out when things are happening that shouldn’t be and it will also help her to encourage subordinates and peers.
. Holynne helps out the flight greatly. She contributes in class and helps out fellow members quite a bit. She always has a positive attitude and is eager learn.
. You are like our flight mom. You are always caring and making sure that people are doing the right thing.
. She always thinks of others and is very kind. She always checks on her flight mates and makes sure no one is falling behind.. She has a talent for prioritizing and keeping stressful situations in perspective. She knows how to value what is important and gives 100% effort on a daily basis.. She has a positive attitude and makes everyone around her smile. You can tell by the way she carries herself that she is very professional and has a wealth of experience in life and in the Air Force. I trust her.
. Steppe has been an incredible help for me in my Intel/War gaming GLP. I've felt somewhat lost and overwhelmed with the tasks because I don't have any operational intel experience yet, and it's a demanding role. She took it on herself to help me get organized and get my mind wrapped around the ins and outs of the project.
. You are one of the flight's top contributors which has helped the flight function better overall. On our second FLP (running with weights), not only did you get mission complete, but your planning and execution led us to finish it with plenty of time to spare. Your assistance with flight organization has been a tremendous asset to our group performance.
. Holynne shared her personal life details and how she acts as a guardsman, has a fulltime civilian job, and still somehow manages to run a non-profit supporting inner city youths. For all intents and purposes, she is a mom to those kids, which underscores the compassion she has. She earned the nickname Mom in the flight for exhibiting these character traits, she certainly has expanded that compassion to her fellow cadets.
. Holynne is a born leader. She is hardworking, caring, determined, organized, intelligent, and an awesome mentor (to name a few qualities). I am glad that I get to be apart of her flight and that I am able to call her a friend.. I want to be like Holynne when I grow up. She seems to really have her life together. She takes care of everyone around her but is still able to take care of herself and not let things stress her out or bog her down. She is someone that inspires me to be better and work harder.. Holynne is somebody that people gravitate to and want to learn from. She is great a treading people and giving critiques and feedback. She is a great teacher and is willing to help anyone who needs it. I am grateful to have her in my flight.
. Holynne had noticed how Michael was having difficulty performing in the flight, and took the initiative to talk with him. She also asked another cadet to mentor him. I found this to be an outstanding example of what a supervisor should do.. Holynne would immediately take tasks when performing in GLPs and ILOs, which shows she knows her capabilities and willingness to be on the team.. Holynne puts a high priority on dorm maintenance. Anytime I fall behind in the morning or end up struggling to take care of duties, she will always ask “What do you need? What can I help with?” I appreciate how she will help even when I am hot mess. Holynne is a great wingman!
. Cadet Steppe is a true leader and major asset to flight 1-17. She takes care of people and has the ability to notice when others are in need of assistance. Cadet Steppe was the first of few cadets to approach me after realizing I was on the edge of falling short of the academic average and without hesitation offered me her assistance. The flight would not be the same without her leadership skills.",23

I was certainly impressed with his overall effort and I would trust him to lead me into any situation at any given time.. Connor was a flight mate of mine during week 2 and we noticed his ability to make light of hard situations. It was extremely helpful to have him there as a relief in our class.

In times of hardship, I think all group dynamics benefit from humor and in the end, it brings the entire group morale up.. Connor was in our flight in week two and he continued to work on marching. During an assessment, he was put in charge of the flight once again to march us around the drill pad. He stepped up, and took the assignment and tried his best.

While serving as the cadet Wg/CV, she perfectly balanced leading the Wing and being a critical part of the flight. She will make an excellent leader.. In addition to her commanding presence, TR also has a great heart. The Four Lenses would classify her as a ""blue"" and it's spot on. She is pragmatic and caring, two qualities that make her very effective in any leadership position.
. Cadet Torres strength is her focus. During the HAWK challenge and the Commander's Run I was very motivated by her actions. In the HAWK challenge she seemed like she was struggling with the long run, but at the end she sprinted as hard as she could just to beat the other flight. She had a look of determination regardless of her physical state. It was very motivational, so I decided to sprint and catch up to her. She did the same for the Commander’s run.
. Cadet Torres is very intelligent and she frequently share her knowledge with the class. She is not afraid to speak up when she has something to contribute. This benefits everyone around her because they are able to learn more from her that they otherwise may not have had the opportunity to learn. This will help her as a leader because she will be able to ensure that her subordinates have the knowledge necessary to complete their tasks effectively.

She is a skilled multi-tasker and has a great sense of awareness. She keeps the future in mind to anticipate upcoming problems.. She puts others first and leads by example. She is very practical and is not afraid to speak up or question something if the situation doesn't feel right.
. TR is not afraid to stick up for herself or her people! She is the momma bear of the flight. It's awesome watching passionately defend her opinion in discussion.
. Cadet Torres-Rivera is a bit competitive. She almost tackled me playing Frisbee before she became the team cheerleader, keeping everyone laughing with Cadet Nunn.. Cadet TR is passionate when she is knowledgeable. The areas that she has experience and knowledge you can tell how much she cares and is engaged when she shares. It definitely deepens everyone's understanding on the subject with her insight.. Cadet TR is in tune with flight members. There have been a few times when she has noticed others a bit down and stepped in to bring a smile and check on them. Her impressions and voices also keep the flight tone light-hearted and fun and she uses them at appropriate times.
. Jamie took on the role of Vice Wing Commander very well and did a good job. She knows when to step up and take command. There have been times when members of the flight were acting up and she took the initiative to tell them to act correct.",15

It may have been too hot to finish but the groups that went through went smoothly.. Matthew Malecha's organization and logical planning proved fruitful when we went out to WELPS. There was very little confusion and the exercise went smoothly.
. Cadet Malecha has proven his good organizational skills through his setup of the HELPS event.. Cadet Malecha has consistently improved in his academics exemplifying excellence in all we do.. Cadet Malecha has proven to make good decisions under pressure through his performance in his first field leadership position.
. He's very professional. He never says things that are off-color and I feel like whatever I tell him is safe from judgement.. He's quite wise. Every time he contributes to group discussions, it's clear he has anew point of view that we haven't considered yet.. He's a hard worker. I can tell that he puts lots of time into completing his assignments. His room is immaculate. I draw inspiration from seeing those things.
. Matt took another cadet and I to the side and respectfully showed us how we were falling into formation incorrectly. Matt had to redo the HELPS chalks after it originally got cancelled due to weather and I didn't hear him complain once about it.. Matt took time out of his own schedule to create flashcards on quiz let for the rest of the flight to use for studying.
. Cadet Malecha demonstrated his personal excellence in his organizing of the Helps and Welps activities.. Cadet Malecha has always been very willing to step up whenever the flight has needed him to.. Cadet Malecha strives for excellence in his work without trying to pass off any of his responsibilities on others.
. I like Cadet Malecha's humor. I have enjoyed getting to see his personality over the weeks. Very dry wit and high competency makes him a guy I would work for, with, or have him work for me any day.
. Very knowledgeable.",17

Michael De Leon took charge of becoming an element leader when one of our element leaders had more pressing matters. His initiative kept the flight together.. Michael De Leon helped me work on a core workout during one of the morning physical training sessions. It really helped me by teaching me new exercises.
. Cadet Miller is consistently a top performer in all areas: academics, physical fitness, and military customs and courtesies.. Cadet Miller is always quick to volunteer as a wingman when people need one. It makes him a top contributor to the flight.. Cadet Miller is good at keeping a positive attitude which is a force multiplier for the flight.
. Incredibly professional. He always keeps the discussion clean and on-point. I've never seen him fight dirty.. He's always upbeat. If there's every a time when he gets upset because he doesn't agree with a decision that's made about his level, he's certainly never shown it. He 'soften the voice say ""lets get it done."". He openly shares his knowledge. Not only does he dedicate plenty of time to study and self-furtherance, but he also openly shares the information he gained from it. He's helped me immensely with corrections and clarifications.
. Michael is always pushing himself to improve his already impressive PT scores. Michael gave another cadet encouragement when they failed a couple of assessments.. Michael offered to learn to be the backup guidon bearer even when he was not confident in performing the role.
. Cadet Miller has shown a commitment to excellence throughout his training at TFOT, being one of the top performers in the class.. Cadet Miller has shown great versatility by volunteering to serve as a back-up element leader and guidon bearer in our flight.. Cadet Miller's work ethic has been an inspiration to all of our flight members as he works toward obtaining an NATO pilot position.
. Miller obviously we are enemies, but I will admit for an enemy you were always really helpful. You would take time out of your schedule to help anyone who asked, and sometimes anyone who needed help but hadn't gotten up the courage to ask yet.. I truly believe you're going to make an awesome officer, not only because you give110% into literally everything you do but because you also care about those around you. I know I mentioned how you'll help people who ask, but you also make sure everyone is okay. If someone isn't having the best day you're right there helping out.. You are literally awesome in just about everything you do, which is super annoying for everyone competing with you, but is also a nice change to see in someone. It was also nice because it pushed everyone else to be better. Miller, seriously, you should be really proud of yourself.
. Cadet Miller, Sharp cat. Dude is gonna go places. Gonna get there fast. Needs to fly 22's or 35's.
. Very motivating, wants to see everyone succeed.. Works hard to excel in all areas, very well-rounded.. Takes on extra responsibilities without hesitation (back up Guidon Bearer, Element Leader).
. Intelligence is easily one of the biggest strengths I have seen. There have been very few conversations or battles of wit that you haven't appeared extremely comfortable in.. You are very relatable and polite. Even with how direct our class can be, you have never treated anyone with any sort of negative attitude.. Diligence. During your short time as flight commander that I have seen so far, you have more desire to do things right than any of the other flight commanders that I have seen. This motivation and pursuit of excellence is inspiring.",25

Stevan Sheely continued his leadership well after his flight leader role when Cadet Zach Bodie injured and could not march the flight. He continued to perform marching the flight until a new flight leader was assigned.
. Cadet Sheely is very knowledgeable in military customs and courtesies. He makes the flight better by calling people on their mistakes.. Cadet Sheely sets up flight morale events every weekend making sure that everyone can decompress from the stresses of OTS.. Cadet Sheely is the person that everyone can go to when they have software or computer issues. It's a very valuable skill that really helps the flight.
. He's always willing to help others. I've never seen him turn down somebody down when they asked him for assistance. When I was sick, he took over the physical portion of my additional duty so I could get better quicker. I owe him.. When he was flight leader, he always made sure to put the flight before his own needs. Many times I saw him do flight tasks, organizing, and planning for the flight instead of studying during AOPS.. He's been awesome at helping us with admin tasks. When anything needs printed, scanned, or copied, he's the go-to guy. I keep trying to give him money for his materials, but he refuses every time.
. Stevan printed copies of paperwork for the AFEX simulation when the printer I was using ran out of ink.. Stevan takes charge in organizing the weekly dominoes dinner for the flight.. Stevan gave me good constructive feedback during the peer feedback session.. Cadet Sheely has the longest military history in our flight. He carries with him a wealth of experience that has been a tremendous asset, especially for non-prior service members of the flight.. Cadet Sheely demonstrated his commitment to excellence while serving as our flight commander in week 4 of training. He's high level of leadership allowed him to assume command with minimal turbulence and he was proficient in this role within24 hours of starting it.. Cadet Sheely excelled at performing the combative exercises and was an excellent training partner. His learning aptitude and humility combined with his high level of personal discipline allow him to excel in all aspects of TFOT training both in and out of the classroom.
. Provides wisdom in group conversations by drawing on past experience.. Always is willing to help anyone in need, even before being asked to do so.. As flight leader, has taken measures to make sure the flight has all the information he is given. Shows outstanding leadership qualities whenever needed.
. Stevan once helped me out by helping me out during a debate. It was helpful because I was running out of things to say, my argument was becoming circular and weakening due to repetition.. I was once stuck at the dry cleaners and he gave me a ride back to the OTS complex. He helped me. It was hot that day.
. Flight Leader week 4 - very good at managing people/time.. Very focused, great military bearing.. Shows great initiative, always thinking ahead.
. Despite me asking for help way too many times, you have never made me feel like an inconvenience. You have always helped me immediately without hesitation.. You greatly showed your passion during your flight commander role. You remained clearly dedicated to your fellow cadets and actively sought to take care of us.. You have a very enjoyable presence. In a stressful environment, you are always a calming personality.",26

You are calm, cool, and collected keeping those that follow you at a calm state and low stress level.. You have a sense of humor, and I find you trying to spread some cheer throughout the group, keeping morale high.. Me and Bill first met in 2013 at the university of South Alabama studying mechanical engineering. He helped me with numerous difficult engineering courses and he always encouraged/motivated me to be my best. I didn't have a car at the time and Bill always volunteered to take me to study groups and various other places that helped me get through my hardship and achieve my engineering Degree.. As long as I known Bill he always exhibited strong leadership traits. He leads by example by his hard work ethic, determination, loyalty, and intelligence.. Bill would give the shirt off his back to help someone. His selflessness and positive attitude will uplift any team he is with. Him helping me get through my engineering Degree and numerous other occasions can attest to that.. Work Ethics My brother and I both worked at Sam's Club but at different times. Billy always makes friends where ever he goes. The employees and managers always talked good about him because he had such a good work ethic. He followed the exact procedures. Every time he came into Sam's club, I would always over hear the managers asking him when he was going to return to work. This was a summer job for him when he was home from college. When my brother helped my grandfather, who owns his own electrical business, he worked in the heat, digging ditches, crawling under mobile homes and climbing in hot attics of over 100 degrees to pull wire or what ever had to be done. He is not afraid of hard work. My brother has always been a good worker with an awesome work ethic where ever he has been employed.. Volunteering When my brother and I were younger, we would volunteer at ""Gates of Success"". This was a place dedicated to helping special needs children to learn motor functions like how to move their fingers, arms, hands and so on. They helped the children to gain better control of their movements through riding horses. My brother was very dedicated and would go every Saturday that he had a ride there. He would walk along beside the horses while the children rode them. Billy is very strong minded and kind to the situation. The owners absolutely loved him, because he had a phenomenal amount of patience with both the horses and the children.. Inspirational My brother has always been very inspirational to me. He always has tried to encourage me to make better choices and do what is best for me and my son. For example, he has always been big into fitness and a healthier lifestyle then what we grew up with. When he realized he needed to lose a little weight to make the requirements for the Air Force, he didn't waste anytime nor hesitate. He ate what was needed and made sure he did his two hour work outs every night after he got off work. Seeing the motivation he has, has motivated not only me to make better choices, but my dad too. Every night Billy worked out, he would always ask me if I or anyone else wanted to join him, and when I said no he kept asking. He may not be here physically because he is starting his career off, but he is still inspiring me and my dad to make a healthier lifestyle change in the choices we make daily.. Maturity and Focus Billy is a determined person. From the time that he was in middle school, he knew what he wanted to be. He aligned all of his classes from then until high school graduation to aim at his career. He even took a college course during his senior year to help the process. While other kids were thinking about skipping school or what they were doing for the weekend or what ever else they think about, Billy was thinking about his future and what he needs to do to prepare for it. He has always been significantly more mature than other kids his age. He has 2 childhood friends that he grew up with that remain close to him. He hangs out with people that (in his mind) have their priorities straight. He has always been very selective of the company he keeps. For Billy, things were always black and white. But I think life is showing him that there is a little grey area and that people make mistakes sometimes and it doesn't necessarily mean that they are a bad person. Billy has always been the type of person that makes for proud parents. He even got the stamp of approval from the parents of the girls he dated. I'm not saying he is perfect because everyone makes mistakes and has faults but my husband and I could not have asked for a better son.. Helping Hand Billy volunteered to help my dad brick my mailbox after a neighbor ran into the first one with her car and destroyed it. It means a lot to me that my dad bricked my house and my mailbox. His health was already failing him at that time, in 2005 when Billy was only 13. But last year when my dad volunteered to build a replacement mailbox, I didn't think he could do it because his health is a lot worse now, but he insisted. My dad use to be one of the best brick masons around. So Billy, knowing the situation and being older this time around, volunteered to help my dad brick my mailbox. He stayed with him the whole 3 days and did what ever my dad told him to do to get it done. Billy knew nothing about laying brick but he was not afraid of the hard work that he knew went along with it. That job, back in the day, would have taken my dad about 6 hours to finish by himself, but this time he was struggling to get it done in 3days. Billy was his support even though he could have skipped out on him, but that is not his nature. He wanted to make things easier for my dad. So in the end, they built a beautiful mailbox together.. Good Core, Spiritual Person Billy has always had a good heart. When he was 7 or 8, we put him in mixed martial arts. He competed in tournaments. When he practiced at home, he grappled with his dad who was also in mixed martial arts. He got used to grappling against his dad so when he went up against bigger opponents, size was not an issue for him. He won a number of tournaments, but I will never forget one match in particular. He won on a choke out. After the match was called, the other little boy went over to his mother and had tears in his eyes. Billy did not hesitate to go over and hug that little boy and ask him if he was OK. He showed so much compassion. I was so proud of him. He has always studied his bible and even encouraged me and other people at times. So I would like to give a story that I have word for word in his baby book. Just before he turned 5, we had a conversation after church one day. While we were riding down the road, Billy said ""Momma?"". I said ""What?"". He says ""People don't fall down in Heaven?"". I told him ""No, there is no pain or sadness in Heaven"". He said ""You don't get thirsty in Heaven?"". I said ""No"". He said ""It doesn't hurt because they fall on the clouds and they are soft"". I told him ""Heaven is way up past the clouds"". He told me ""I want to go to Heaven, I'm ready to die"". I almost cried at his scary show of innocence. I gathered my self together and told him ""You can't go to Heaven until God says it's time, and if you kill yourself, you'll go to hell"". He didn't say anything after that. He still has that passion.. Billy (my son) and I share a lot of things in common. One of them is ""Cruising the Coast"", which is one of the biggest classic car shows in the south. After a Saturday of looking at many amazing cars, there was one car that always escaped our eyes. We were a little disappointed that we never could see this legendary car. Driving bumper to bumper in a beautiful traffic jam filled with classic and exotic cars and rat rods, we looked over and saw the pinnacle of our search, the legendary outlaw 1970Superbird. We took a hard left turn into a Hooter's parking lot just to be upset to see that it was a Super bee created to look like a Super bird, but still, a nice vehicle in it's own. The owner of the Superbee said his buddy had a Superbird at Edgewater Mall. We raced over there in bumper to bumper traffic at 10 miles an hour to see if we could get a glimpse of the legend, the car that eluded us for many ""Cruising the Coast"" car shows. To make a short story shorter, we finally found the Superbird. It was one of those moments in life of perfection where you and your son share in the perfect moment, as he started telling me about all the tech on that car that changed automobiles forever.. One day, Billy came home from school and told me about a boy that was messing with him. Billy may have been in 4th grade at the time. From what I can remember of what Billy told me about the boy, he was one of the loud, obnoxious kids that would look for other kids to intimidate. Billy, being a quiet person, and not one to draw attention to himself, became his next victim. The boy started to become more aggressive with Billy. Unfortunately for him, Billy and I had trained in martial arts. Now here is where I was impressed. Billy took the boy and put him in a standing arm lock and spun him to the ground. Once the boy was locked down and face first on the ground, instead of breaking his arm or shoulder, Billy just got up and walked away. Never again did that boy mess with Billy, but he was still a loud mouth.. I came home from work one day, after having one of those days where I questioned what and why am I here, doing what I'm doing. I told Billy how it sucked working for someone else. Then I told him to ""get your education and go to college"". When you talk to kids or youth, you don't know if you are making a difference. Billy was only in8th grade when we had that talk. After talking to him recently, I was told, that talk we had that day was the reason why his grades started to improve and he was motivated to become an engineer. Even in 8th grade, he was mature enough to comprehend the words that were told to him that day, enough to focus on it long term.. When we were young children, we spent a majority of our time in our grandparents 'back yard, most of which was comprised of a dense woodland, mainly pines which stretched out for several acres and beyond. As we played on the swing set one day, I being about 3, Billy's sister Ariel was 4, my brother 5, and Billy about 8, Billy heard a rustle from the bushes behind us. He quickly convinced us to run to the porch. As we arrived, I glanced over my shoulder to see a pig crashing out of the woods. I likened it closer to Pumba of the Lion King than Wilbur of Charlotte's web. It was closing in fast as Billy held the screen door open and allowed us to reach shelter before he did, with the beast nipping close at his heels. He slammed the door behind us just in time. Even at a young age, Billy showed an astuteness seldom found in even adults; being able to see the danger that was imposed from the obscured creature in the forest.. When we were not outside, we spent much of our time playing video games like many other children our age. Equipped with whichever system he had at the time, along with an adapter and enough controllers that we wouldn't be forced to take turns, Billy was always making sure that everyone was able to play. He followed a strict moral code of fairness: inclusiveness and not cheating were very important to him. We almost exclusively played co-operatively, yet any competitive games were still fun for everybody rather than just the winner. He has kept this ethic throughout his entire life. When one speaks of the likes of Napoleon, Stalin, or Hitler, it is easy to refer to them as strong leaders, but very seldom will one be able to call them good leaders. The humanization required to be such is an aspect of leadership that I feel many have and will lose sight of; a good leader has the interests of all at heart, rather than just those of a small group or even themselves.. Another quality which is more often overlooked in leadership is the dynamic with which a leader works within a group, whether as the leader or not. A true leader is able to shift the direction of a group onto the right path whether or not that leader has the place of authority to make final decisions. When Billy and I worked together for our grandfather, he was always quick to step in when he knew something was being done incorrectly or could be done better. When he saw flaws in our operative plans, he did not hesitate to speak up with his suggestions. Similarly, when we were young, he would always ask for everyone's ideas and let all of his group speak their minds before we did anything. This only shows that, whether or not a leader is in the lead, the leader will lead.. William Burke IV (aka Billy) has been my best friend for about ten years. He has been there for me in some of the lowest points in my life to offer support and reassurance. When I think of the word “loyalty”, I cannot think of any other person who best fits that attribute. Billy has gone above and beyond for his friends on multiple occasions. One such occasion that sticks out to me is on June 23, 2017 in the early morning hours on his birthday. I was visiting Billy from out of state as I was invited to attend his going away party before he left for the Air Force Officer Training School. We had dinner with his family earlier that night since his mother would be working on his birthday. He drove me back to the hotel where I was staying in Gulfport, Mississippi. As he was dropping me off he received a text message from one of his best friends Blake. Blake’s truck would not start and he was stranded in a parking garage in Biloxi, Mississippi which was about twenty or so minutes from where we were. Billy did not hesitate to respond to help his friend even though he was tired as it was around 12:00 AM. I went with him to meet Blake in the parking garage. When we arrived, Blake’s truck was there, but there was no sign of Blake. We assumed he went inside one of the buildings in the area, but when we searched we were still unable to find him. Billy continued to try to get a hold of him by phone, but Blake's phone kept sending him immediately to voicemail. Billy talked to staff members within the buildings to see if anyone had seen him and continued searching. After about an hour of looking for Blake, we went back out to the parking garage to check his truck again. This time the truck door was open and Blake was inside charging his phone. Blake explained that he had needed a phone charger and so he went to buy one across the street. It was now around 2:00 AM. Billy hooked the jumper cables to his car and attached them to Blake’s truck. He tried multiple different ways to get Blake’s truck started, but it wouldn’t make any sounds. Blake mentioned to Billy that if we could get the truck out of the parking garage that Geico said they could tow it for him. Billy also thought of something we could try as we were pushing the truck to help start it since it was a manual transmission. Billy helped to organize the plan. Blake rode in the inside of the truck and Billy and I pushed the truck around the parking garage and down the ramp. The truck still did not start, but we now had it out of the parking garage and in a parking lot near the harbor. Blake called Geico, but by this time they now were closed. Blake had given up hope and was ready to just leave his truck there. Billy refused to give up as he knew Blake's truck would get towed if he left it in that parking lot. Billy and I were able to get in contact with AAA for them to come tow Blake’s truck. Billy stayed with Blake for the additional hour it took for AAA to arrive. Blake left with AAA and his truck back to his house and Billy took me back to the hotel. It was now around 4:30 AM and Billy stayed awake until he heard from Blake to make sure that Blake had made it home safe. This story is one of many that demonstrates his character. Billy was tired, but helped out his friend anyway. It was Billy’s birthday, but he never complained or made Blake feel bad for calling him to help. It wasn’t easy to push the big truck through the parking garage and down the ramp, but Billy never gave up. Billy stayed to ensure that everyone got home safely and that his friend was taken care of. Billy is the most loyal person I have ever met.. William Burke IV (aka Billy) is always the first to volunteer to help others. He has participated in coastal cleanups organized through his college. He donates blood to help save other people's lives. When in college he organized a car show so members of the community could enjoy seeing classic cars and to this day his college still hosts the annual car show he helped to start. Billy has consistently put others before himself. One example that comes to mind is when he came to visit me in California. Billy, my husband, and I were hiking on a trail through the mountains to a waterfall. This was a trail my husband and I had done many times, but Billy had never been to California before. We ventured a little off of the trail to climb up some rocks. I had made it to the top and was sitting up there looking at the view of the waterfall. My husband was climbing the side of the hill to get to where I was and Billy was following behind him. My husband slipped and began to slide down the mountain on his back. Billy didn't hesitate to change his position and catch my husband even though it caused both of them to slide slightly before coming to a stop. This move that Billy did to save my husband from getting hurt could’ve put Billy’s life at risk. Neither one of them were hurt. On multiple occasions Billy has offered to tutor friends who are struggling with an assignment in school. Billy volunteers to help his family with projects including helping to repair their cars if there is ever a mechanical issue. Billy is a wealth of knowledge and is always willing to share what he knows with others.. William Burke IV (aka Billy) is determined to succeed in every aspect of his life and does not accept failure as an option no matter how challenging the situation may get. When Billy found out he had been accepted to join the Air Force he was so excited. He began training immediately running six miles a day and doing P90X.There were days when he would come home from work late, but still complete his training even if it meant getting less sleep or relaxation time for himself. There were days when it was scorching hot outside and humid, but he would run anyways. There were multiple occasions when the Mississippi weather was not favorable to him, but he would run in the rain anyway. When Billy was visiting me in California, I had showed him my 1997 Z28 Camaro and took him for a ride in it. As we were driving he noticed my radio was on demo mode and asked why I had it that way. I let him know that my car battery had died at one point years ago and that it reset to demo mode, but I couldn’t figure out how to turn it off. Billy messed with the settings until he figured out how to turn it off for me. He spent a lot of time searching for this setting, but was determined to fix it for me. One night when he was at my apartment he noticed that my dogs laser light toy was broken. It was one of those “cat” toys that has two laser lights and spins in circles, but my dog loves it. He asked if he could take a look at it to try to fix it. I told him not to worry about it and that I would just buy another one. He wanted me to save money if he could fix it. He sat there determined to fix it for about an hour as my dog watched him like he was performing surgery on his favorite toy. Billy was able to repair the problem and get the toy working again. The toy did end up breaking shortly after because of a spring snapping, but Billy’s determination to fix this toy for my dog was very inspiring. Billy is determined to get stronger each day. Billy is determined to succeed. Even while Billy was on vacation he made time to train and run to ensure he kept his endurance and strength up. Billy never gives up. His motivation and drive is inspiring. He is creative when solving problems and thinks outside the box for solutions. While it is hard for me to understand just how challenging Air Force Officer Training School can be, I know that Billy has the determination and skills needed to not only make it through this training, but to be one of the best leaders within the United States Air Force",33

Zach never waits to be told to act; rather, he steps up and takes action. A perfect example of this was demonstrated during one of our band trips in Florida. We arrived to our site earlier than expected and the 500 member organization was becoming anxious for direction. Rather than waiting for instruction, Zach commandeered the equipment staff and recruited various other members in order to begin the unloading process. Zach led this initiative by controlling the environment and delegating multiple tasks throughout the organization. This situation demonstrated Zach’s strong will to lead, decision making ability, and his no hesitation approach to taking initiative.. Zach is at his best when he has the ability to lead. His ability to convey information with precision and efficiency makes him an excellent teacher and leader. I have seen this quality in Zach over and over again as I worked alongside of him during his collegiate career. Whether leading engineering projects, commanding the marching band, or mentoring high school students Zach is committed to his duty as a communicator and leader.. Above all other qualities, Zach is a fierce friend. I had the privilege of working directly with Zach for two years. In the high stress environment of leading an organization while still pursuing an education Zach never failed to be a source of support. Laughing, crying, sweating, bleeding, and leading with Zach is something that I will never be able to forget. Not because of everything that our team accomplished, but rather, because of his dedication to me as a friend. Zach’s dedication to others makes him the strong leader that he is.. Thanks to our time spent together in the ""Pride of the Mountains"" Marching Band at Western Carolina University, I have come to gain a great deal of insight into Zachery's abilities as a leader and problem solver; no issue is to big or too small for his attention. From communication on the field to the program's 500 members, to simply making sure equipment functioned properly during rehearsals, Zach was always able to find solutions quickly and efficiently. Not only would he fix issues but he would improve systems which were already in place. One example of this ability was during a marching band practice, the sky begin to grow dark due to an impending rain storm. The sky opened up and rained out the rehearsal causing all members to rush inside to continue in our school's auditorium. As Drum Majors of the program, it was our responsibility to put away all equipment and make sure it was dried for use at the following practice. Sadly, no system was in place for ""waterproofing"" the equipment which in turn had caused each piece to function pretty poorly. Zach not only helped make sure the supplies was dried after the rainstorm but also suggested some ideas for preventing this problem in the future - such as having a box where all equipment was stored and organized while we were outside at practice. He also pointed out a problem with how we were maintaining equipment (i.e. charging our Long Rangers every evening after rehearsals, causing the battery to drain). Thanks to Zach's ability to quickly save our supplies and suggest new ideas to prevent future problems, we never had an issue with rain again. Zachery never fears from taking charge and troubleshooting a problem - we were very lucky to have him as a member of our team.. One of the most admirable traits Zachery possesses is his willingness to do any task he is assigned. Without hesitation, he will go do what he is instructed to do and will volunteer to complete any task. There were times during our marching band rehearsals where we'd forget equipment in our university's band room (which would be up to a 10 minute walk away). If this would occur, Zach would always be the first volunteer to run (emphasis on run) all the way back to the and band room and grab whatever supplies we were missing. He'd be back in a flash each time, would set the equipment up for use and would jump right back on the podium to continue conducing/leading the rehearsal. During practices, the ensemble would be split up into various groups for ""sectionals"" (where pieces of the marching show would be rehearsed). If one of these groups needed a Drum Major to lead, Zach would always go wherever help was needed. Lending a hand and supporting the group always was of vital importance to him. No matter the task at hand, Zach would dive into any situation without a question - always ready to take instruction without question/debate. This kind of dedication cannot be taught but is a core component of what makes Zach, Zach.. There are many times life consistently beats us up and makes us feel nothing is possible - Zachery on the other hand never lets anything life throws him get him down. He is always a positive role model, doing what's right and not what's easy. As many organizations have, our university's marching band had many cliques and exclusionary groups, which caused many individuals to feel left out/unwanted. Zach never met a stranger and always tried his best to make every person in the program feel valued. Whether someone was struggling with picking up different marching techniques, to someone simply sitting by themselves at lunch, he would always make an effort to go strike up a conversation. His friendliness and constant encouragement built each member up. Not only would he provide constructive criticism but he would be kind, listen to their questions and concerns, and inspire greatness within. This ability to teach and remain positive in undesirable situations is the kind of skill I wish more people in this world had. I always felt Zachery encouraged me to perform at the highest level possible and built up my confidence. Those who he has met and taught are truly blessed to have known him.. A main example that I found Zachary at his best would be my experience watching him prepare to audition as the Drum Major for Pride of the Mountains marching band at Western Carolina University. At this time Zach and I still lived in low end dorm rooms located on the WCU property. Zach would walk out to the hall every day and stand in front of the full length mirror. From here he would practice his daily motions that a drum major must be able to master. Even with the amount of distractions and noise that comes from an ""all boys"" dorm, Zach continued to show his persistence and dedication to what he wanted to become. He changed his lifestyle in a way to form around the goals he had set to accomplish. After all this self conditioning, and hard work, he was capable of becoming the new drum major, and consistently held the high position for 2 years at WCU.. Another fond memory of Zach would be our time spent mountain biking. When leaving for a ride he always had a positive attitude and excitement to him even if he knew it was going to be tough. Zach saw each adventure as room for improvement and progress rather quickly. When he wanted to work on his form, he was never afraid to ask for advice and always worked to his best ability to achieve what he was doing. As trails got tougher and more technical Zach never complained and only pushed forward. His mental state was exceptional on longer rides, and his attitude was always positive throughout the tough adventures. Even during his tight schedule with his engineering degree, and the handful position as drum major, Zach always found a way to progress his hobbies alongside his peers.. Being a close peer to Zach, and also living closely with him for years, I was able to catch on to a lot of his personal traits. He summed most of these traits up his senior year at WCU. Time management was a strong trait though out these last semesters. Zach had to balance a very hectic life style that involved personal fitness, hobbies(fly fishing, mtn biking, hiking, and canoeing), drum major roles, an engineering degree, and high GPA standards. His leadership roles were also tested during his capstone project through that year. From an outsider perspective I was able to seethe slack that was in his group, and his abilities to keep them all together and on track. Zach used a lot of his personal skills to keep the team progressing while still following the rest of his individual goals. When a time crunch came he was able to control the group in a manner that the deadline would be completed. He always spoke up when the need was there, and always gave his full potential on assignments. Some of his best work was from stepping out of his comfort zone. His ability to work in such high stress environments is impressive from many view points. I haven't met anyone else that can hold themselves at the standard he does, while still progressing such a lifestyle.. One of Zachary's strengths is being able to look at a situation in many perspectives. His mind is unlike anyone else I have ever met. He is able to look at a problem from someone else's view, a realistic view, or just simply keep out of a situation. He knows the right time to speak out or to not say anything. He helps people in every way that he can, but also knows when they have to figure it out themselves. There was a time in my life where I had to be in control of everything. I had to fix everyone's problems and if it didn't go the way I planned, I got very upset. There was many times that Zachary tried to tell me that I didn't have to fix everyone's problems or control everything. Of course, I didn't listen and he knew that anything he said would have no affect on me. He let me go through my problems and eventually(and painfully) I figured it out on my own. I learned that trying to fix problems that I really had no control over was exhausting, and in the end I only hurt myself. If Zachary did not let me go and figure it out myself, I know I would be a lot worse today. I think that one of his powerful strengths is knowing how to let someone or something go when the time calls for it.. Hard working is the definition of Zachary. He is honestly the hardest worker I have ever met. He has accomplished so many things through the time that I have known him, and he worked for all of it. He worked hard as drum major in high school of a band that was probably about only thirty people, but he treated it as a band of one-hundred people. He worked with our new band director and showed her the ropes of our, ""we don't like change,"" band program. Then he really soared in college. He started from the bottom by working on equipment crew and worked his way up to drum major of a four-hundred member band. He was the hardest working drum major and cared more about the members than the ""fame"" and ""power"" that went with it. Even though he was one of the top leaders in the band he still helped with equipment crew and any other staff that needed it. He is a true leader because instead of putting himself on a pedal stool, he gets on the ground and works with his teammates.. Zachary's strength of being a hard worker goes hand in hand with his academics. All through college he has worked hard, especially in his engineering classes. Sure he had many rough days, but I don't think I have ever seen him truly fail. Through painful library days, late nights, and lazy partners, he pushed through it all till the very end. I remember many days that he would work all day, go to band practice, and work a late night. I remember many cancelled phone dates because he had to finish homework, a project, or meeting with a study group. At the time, I would be upset but only because I really didn't know what he was going through. When I finally came to college and was able to see all the hard work he did, I was impressed and in awe. I didn't realize that those cancelled phones dates were the reason he made A'son his exams. I didn't understand that he was setting himself up for a successful future, and I am proud to say that I get to be apart of it. He has so many wonderful qualities, but his most important strength is himself. His personality, his commitment, his determination, his kindness, his leadership, and his discipline is what makes him, him. After many years of his hard work, he is finally where he belongs; a United States Airman.. Encouragement – I had the honor and privilege of working with Zachery and two others as Drum Majors for the Western Carolina University “Pride of the Mountains ""Marching Band. When I was selected in December of 2015, I joined the team as the only new member and the only female. From the moment I was selected I instantly felt welcomed by Zach. Throughout the season Zach was always encouraging me to do my best, and insisting that I could and would be great. He helped teach me how everything worked and helped me find my place in my new role. His support was invaluable to me throughout the season, and I don’t think I would have been able to step up into my new role, or be as confident as I am in it today, without it.. Positivity – During my year of working alongside Zach as Drum Major, I can clearly remember being inspired by his positivity. Before I met Zach, I had always heard, ""Zach has never said a bad thing about anyone!” and I quickly came to see the truth in that statement. No matter how stressful things became, Zach was always smiling and happy; a light in the darkness. I am a firm believer that positivity will get you very far in life, and in that regard Zach is an inspiration to me and many others.. Selflessness – One of the most inspiring things about Zach is his selflessness. He isn't in leadership positions for fame, glory, or recognition. He was a Drum Major for the betterment of the band and his team. When Zach was asked to perform on the back sideline during our marching show, he didn’t hesitate to accept it even if it meant that he wouldn’t have the center podium at all his senior year. When he was given the opportunity to have the center podium for a pregame performance instead of myself, a first year Drum Major, he declined. Everything Zach did all season was for the band, never himself. I’ve never seen someone so consistently put others before themselves and not even bat an eye. His selflessness alone has been my greatest inspiration throughout my time working alongside him, and I will not soon forget it.",15

I met Jon a few years ago when I PCS’d to WPAFB. I can remember clearly sitting in an empty cubicle going over information for my first qualification. Jon walks up to me and the conversation goes like this: Jon: What are you doing? Me: I am studying for this qualification. Jon: Well my name is Jon. Yours? Me: Justin. Jon: Well, Justin, I need you to come with me and help me do something that will actually help you here at the unit and with your qualification. Me: Oh yes? What is that? Jon: Just come with me. Jon led me to the roof of our building. He said, “You see that antennae? You’re going take that apart and put it in these cases.” I was extremely nervous and had no idea what I was doing. He explained every detail of the tear-down and all of the intricate pieces of the antennae and how it operated. Jon and I learned a great deal about each other that day and became very close colleagues and friends. His no nonsense and hands on approaches to numerous issues have taught me a great deal since meeting him.. About a year had passed since Jon had taught me how to take apart the antennae and many other key elements to our job, when the opportunity to deploy came up. Jon is a very well-respected member of our unit and his opinions and insight into manning, training, and deployments is always highly considered. I explained to Jon that I would love to go on this deployment and learn as much as I can about the equipment as I possibly could. Not only did Jon get me on the deployment, he gave me a crash course in a vast majority of the equipment and software programs we would use on the deployment to better prepare me. Being my first deployment, I had no idea the processes that were involved in just getting ready to leave. Jon went through our entire out-processing checklist with me and gave me sound advice on the timeline I needed to complete things in. He even took time out of his own evening to come to my house and introduce our wives and to explain to my wife everything to expect while we were gone. We also went over a large list of personal items I should bring, along with things that weren’t necessary. Jon is extremely gifted when it comes to planning and organizing. Because of this, my wife and I were more than ready for the upcoming deployment.. A few days before we were to leave for our deployment, I spoke with Jon about going down the OTS route. Becoming an officer in the USAF has always been a goal of mine. When I joined the Air Force, I had a little under two years of college under my belt and only needed one or two classes to complete my Associates Degree. Jon mentored me through getting all my prior coursework submitted to the AF in order to apply it to my CCAF. He then got me started on my Bachelor’s program, in which I only lack about 8 courses until I am finished. If it hadn’t been for Jon pushing me to better myself, I wouldn’t have even considered going back to school. Once we got to our deployment location, Jon’s true leadership began to show. Jon was put in charge of overseeing the mission, manning, and equipment. During the five months we were there, I learned a great deal about our mission and how all our equipment works. Enough so, that I could do it with very little, if any, assistance. I can only attribute that to one person, Jon. While we were deployed, we got the notification that our deployment was being cut short and that we had to pack up everything and bring it home. The crew that had brought everything to the deployed site had roughly twenty members. We had four. Our NCOIC only handled administrative work and put Jon in charge of the tear-down. We were then notified that we had a two-week deadline to have everything torn down, packed up, and ready to ship. Jon sat myself and our other member down and went through a day by day plan for what we were going to do and how long he expected it to take us. Because of Jon’s expertise and his very detailed training he had provided us, we had all our equipment dismantled, cleaned, and prepared for shipment in three days. I would like to add a more personal aspect about Jon. It is very hard to put into words the type of friend Jon is. The day I met Jon, I knew we would be extremely close form any years to come. Jon has been one of the best friends I have ever had. I am on a five-month TDY at the moment. Up until Jon left for OTS, he called me at least twice a week to check on me. He not only checked on me, but also my family. Jon is someone I would trust my life with, along with the lives of others.. Jon deployed with me to Kuwait in June 2014, right away he became the informal leader of the deployed crew. I witnessed his uncanny ability to communicate, persuade and lead airman on a day to day basis. One of the first examples of his communication skills was showcased when he gave me an informal mission brief on the unit deployed operations, Camp Arifjan and AFCENT AOR. I was so impressed with his briefing skills and knowledge on the AOR that I made Jon the official briefer for all DV visits.. Jon charisma and briefing skills also caught the attention of 2x Major Generals. Jon gave MG Gersten (JTF OIR C2) and MG Miller a detailed tour of our compound and the best mission brief I have ever seen. The next day MG Gersten came back and presented Jon with a coin from the 379 AEW/CCC for his professionalism and airmanship. After the visit, I discussed Jon’s desire to commission and MG Gersten told me that he would like to write a Letter of Recommendation and contact the 70ISRW/CC to throw his full support behind Jon’s package.. Jon has a very compassionate side, he has helped countless airman through very difficult situations on and off duty. He is the first one to volunteer when someone needs help moving, cleaning or organizing an events. The story that stands out the most to me actually involves OTS. We had a TSgt in the unit apply for OTS in 2016,the member was selected and a couple weeks before being released from duty the member was contacted by the medical facility and told there was a mistake. He has a rare disease that he was diagnosed with in 2009 and unfortunately his application should have never made it through the medical process. The member was distraught to say the least, his family had already moved, house was sold and his lifelong dream of being an officer was over. Jon took the TSgt into his home, stayed with him around the clock for the first week to ensure he was okay and contacted some former coworkers in San Antonio to see if this TSgt could get a job at 25 AF(His family moved to San Antonio when he was selected to be a RPA operator). Today this TSgt is now a (M)Sgt select and has a new found look on his career path and life.. Jonathan was an only child until 02/14/1993 when he had a sister born Chelsie A Hill. This started a whole new life for this 6-year-old child. His sister was born with Golden Haired Syndrome Which was very rare she was 13th child to ever be born with this and all others died at two weeks are less. We explained this to Jonathan and as much as a 6-year-old understood are so we thought. He wanted to see her which was against the rules but his art of persuasion was great even then. The Doctor took him back he sat with her and talked with her for hours. When he came out he said she well be fine now and he believed that. It was a long road and a lot more talking and crying for me and him he was with her the whole way. She is now 24 years old and still has problems but leans on him still and he is still there to help. Just to finish the story he was in Elementary School and was bring home straight A’s during this time which I fell showed a lot of strength. Jonathan grew up fast and strong and these are still some of his finest traits.. Jonathan best strength in my opinion is his ability to read and understand people. He has always been able to understand and help with situation with Family, Friends, an Co-Workers. He can set and talk to people and come away with info to help and is willing to do so. He is from a large Military family and we are hard to get a read on sometimes a lot of things we don’t want to remember that we have seen, but he can talk to us and before you know the stories come out and he listens until the worst is over and then listen’s some more. He started this at a young age and caries these sometimes-awful stories with him today. I feel it makes him a better Man, Airman, and friend. He has seen things his self now but he knows that he can talk to the right people and not hold inside and that’s a great lesson learned. I believe as an Officer he will continue to help his fellow Airman and others to understand and know they have someone to listen. Listening is a quality few possess in Military.. Jonathan has many strength’s and weakness’s because he is human and in all fairness, I will also tell what I think his weakness is. Jonathan’s weakness is his Heart and ability to help other’s. He sometimes thinks he can fix the world’s problems. This is a good think to a point but it can turn your life upside down also, a point he has learn well in last 10 years of Air Force. He has learned to pick battles and fight the better fight. But he still has a kind heart and he still tries to help and sometimes it puts him at odds with superior’s. He will stand his ground if he fills its right and I think that will make him a wonderful officer.. If there was one word to describe you, it would be loyal. You have always put your family and friends first in every situation. Through my divorce you had my best interests in mind throughout the entire situation. Even threaten to kick Evan's ass if need be. You were very supportive, called me frequently even when deployed, and offered unconditional comfort. You would drive 4 hours just to be by my side if I asked you to. Every since we were little, you have protected those close to you. You show your love by protecting those close to you.. You very hard working. You have never been a lazy person. You work until the job is done. Whether it is while deployed or at home helping Jim's farm. You are always the hardest worker in the room. You are reliable and if asked for help, you will be therefor anyone. You are dependable and you never let people down. I remember one time we were hanging out and you had to stop to go help Jim on the farm. You even helped me reel in that 5lb bass when my weak little arms wouldn't.. Jon is a born leader. People like to be around Jon. His charisma is really high. When we had a peer have a stroke due to an undiagnosed blood disorder he rallied the team to take care of this young man and his family, based in Dallas, for months. He never asks anyone to do something that he would not do himself. I've participated innumerous ""moving parties"" where he has gotten 20+ people to help a family relocate locally. They all show up, on time, and give it their all. And every time Jon was in the lead. He can get anyone to help out for the common cause. One Oktoberfest in Fredericksburg, Texas, we had an extreme scavenger hunt and I was on Jon's team. He somehow convinced a woman, significantly his senior, to provide us the bra and panties she was wearing at the time. We one the competition. He's a guy that can get people to get things done!. Jon is comfortable with himself and so self-assured that he is a standard to aspire to. He takes ownership for his decisions, and his mistakes, like a trooper. I've observed him brief and interact with all levels of leadership with ease and respect, while keeping things light and friendly. One night we were out in Dayton, the Paris of the Midwest, with his wife home and a woman kept hitting on him. As Jon and Taylor are like my kids I thought ""this woman needs back off."" So I walked up, introduced myself as his husband, gave him a kiss on the cheek, and told her he was great in bed. He never missed a beat and went on about how we were married in Massachusetts in the early days. The woman apologized and slinked off.. Jon is loyally dedicated to the people he cares about. He has very strong ties to his blood family and his military family. He has deployed several times and it's evident itis to serve his country and his comrades. He's not much for bureaucracy and paperwork. He loves getting his hands dirty and digging in to fixing problems. I've seen that range from personnel issues, to professional mentoring, to accomplishing mission. Because of what Jon does I cannot go into detail. All I can say is that he will make an outstanding officer.. Jonathan is a go-getter and always reliable when it came to taking action and getting a goal accomplished. During our redeployment, he led the charge on inventorying, packing and managing hundreds of pieces of sensitive computer equipment. He was very imaginative and resourceful in moving pieces of fragile equipment that could weigh upwards of 500 lbs, ensuring all items were not damaged during the shipment process. He was able to accomplish this massive endeavor leading only two other members through the process. If it were not for Jonathan’s leadership abilities and his ingenuity, we would have spent months rather than weeks shutting down a deployment site.. Jonathan, though rough around the edges with a tough guy persona, genuinely cared and empathized with his coworkers and subordinates. He constantly reached out to members of his own crew and other crews to ensure their health and well being. Always quick to lend a helping hand or a listening ear, he never hesitated to go above and beyond for his fellow Airmen. There was a time, through miscommunication and timing, leadership failed one of their members as they were enduring a tough surgery and was placed on convalescent leave for two weeks and isolated from the work center. Jonathan was the only person to reach out to the member to see how they were doing and if they needed food, help or anything.. Jonathan never minced words. You always have a clear understanding of where you stand with him. Loyal, strong minded and goal oriented, Jonathan stands out in a crowd and will continue to do great things.. Jon has proven himself to be a decisive leader that can make quick and rational calls when mission is on the line. Having seen Jon in action while on deployments, he frequently demonstrated this ability. Our mission was sensitive and our equipment would often be impacted by the climate of our deployed location. Without access to trained technicians, it fell to the deployed personnel to repair or come up with various COAs to ensure mission sustainment. Jon readily took charge of the team and provided clear direction in resolving mission outages in a timely manner.. Jon has many great leadership qualities, of which I am sure that you are all aware. One of these qualities that was noticeable from the first day I met Jon was his charismatic nature. We endured a very high operations tempo that often left personnel a little unmotivated. However, Jon always managed to inspire those that heled and worked with to rise to the challenge to complete the mission. Not only did personnel complete the mission, but, under his direction, teams excelled; mission consisted of long days and multiple exercises in which Airmen needed to be at the top of their game. Jon’s leadership made sure that his team did just that.. Jon has demonstrated his ability to complete large/complex tasks in a thorough and timely manner. He was often the technical go-to for leaders within our organization. Jon would break the overall task down into smaller parts, get a team of people together, and assign the broken down tasks to these teams. This is a great strength in a leader because we cannot shoulder the whole load. His ability to delegate when needed showed that he was willing to allow his team to have control of the mission while still meeting the requirements and intent of the unit.",20

When she set's her mind to do something she does incredible things. In High school she did ROTC waking up at 5 and 5:30 am to be able to make it to school by 6 AM to be on time for ROTC. Always having everything ready. During Rifle season, she would make sure to be on top of her game. She would even stop drinking caffeine to make sure that she can perform at her best. She put her 110% into ROTC which showed with all her accomplishments.. Barbara always like to challenge herself. She told me years ago that she wanted to do a marathon. So year by year she would train and slowly increment her training getting 5k’s 10k’s done. She then did her half marathon and not too long after did a full marathon. She wants to improve herself in anyway she can and this was something she really wanted to get under her belt.. One thing I do remember is that we used to have wonderful conversations about many different and random topics. I would come into her room for a moment to tell her something and we would end up chatting longer than expected with the conversation going in many directions. I would consider Barbara a good listener, empathetic and would always giver her honest opinion. These are very important straights to have in a leader.. Ohh this one is good. You were always a go getter and never were afraid of anyone or anything. Well let me tell you about a dumb duo called ERIC and JUAN. These jerks had the bright idea of slapping your littler sisters butt. Well my sister never put up with junk like that. I remember you tossing Eric to the ground like you were hulk Hogan. You got him a couple of times. Juan got the bright idea to try to defend his friend so he tried to pull you off Eric. Instead you got Juan. You GOT HIM GOOD. The next day Juan Went to school with a long sleeve t shirt in 95 degree weather because he had bruising throughout his arm. He then stated man she got me good, I'll never miss with the polish sisters again. Ale jemu dupe zbilaz! You were always ready to do the right thing especially for people that you cared out. You were selfless and powerful all in one.. COMPASSION! You always had a heart for the elderly. I don't know if its because it reminded you of babcia or what. I remember going to dziadusze and there was a grandma carrying 6 bags of groceries home. I remember you did not bat an eye. you ran up to this little babcia and asked her if you can help carry her groceries home. This babcia smiled and was so thankful for the offer. You did it with so much compassion and love and you truly did it from the goodness of your heart. And then remember your little elderly guy in Encinitas who you randomly met and would visit often??? He gave you a bracelet or something. Either way you did it because you know how much it meant to him. You have a heart of gold and a mind of an angel. God gives you opportunities to help others and you always do the right thing.. HARDWORKING! Remember how I was always lazy so I would hide 1 dollar bills throughout my mess and when you cleaned the area you earned that dollar. Yes you were always hard working and would never shy away from work. You Also took a lot of pride into the work you did. Dad would always say ""Jak Bash zrobie to biendze perfect"" Babcia would say ""Bajka to jest bardzo dokladna"" You always did everything the best way. You never half fast anything and to this day that has not changed. Soto sum it up.... You have been living your life to your best potential. You never settle. You are an amazing person with a beautiful heart, a great spirit and a brilliant mind. I am so blessed to have a sister who I can always look up to. I have a sister who will always be there for me and who will always encourage me to do my best. I love you so much and I thank you for all the incredible memories we've had so far. You are a beautiful person and I am proud to call you my SISTER!!!. Basia as I always call Barbara has always amazed me in how much she loves military. She has been in ROTC all through her high school years achieving multiple medals and honors. In her senior year 2001/2002 Barbara was the Brigade Commander. It did not really surprise me to find out that Basia joined service after graduating from UCSD and making it her career. Basia accomplishes whatever she sets her mind to and succeeds.. Barbara ( Basia ) lived with us while our son was recalled to the Marine Corps. At that time, we had acquired a golden retriever puppy. The dog behind our neighbor's house had jumped his fence and bitten the dog next door by his eye. We needed a fence to keep our dog’s safe. Our house lots are a half an acre and our neighbor has a corner lot. Our community covenants required a rail fence. We constructing a three-rail fence from 2 X 8 and 6 X 6 western red cedar timbers with a wire fence that was 5 feet tall. For our yard alone we went through 20 gallons of wood preservative hand brushed on all six sides of each timber for over 400 lineal feet of wood. When we were done with our yard we went next door and help them paint their timbers too. Basia was not a party to any of these decisions, but she worked at night and on weekends for several weeks painting the timbers for our fence and the neighbors fence. It was a long monotonous process of painting boards, moving boards and making more room for boards. She was committed to helping her family, helping the neighbors, keeping the dog’s safe and most of all she was cheerful about it. She kept our spirits up and kept us motivated.. Knowledge makes a difference in our lives. Basia was a Bio-Environmental Engineer with the Air Force. She puts her knowledge to use helping others. For several years I was having trouble with my skin. Every time I got a cut or a scratch, they would all become puffy, red and sore. I did not understand what could be causing this problem. I had not had this problem when I was younger. I described the problem to Basia. She looked at my sores and asked me what kinds of lotion and soaps I was using. She figured out that I was using skin products that had fragrances in them which caused my sores to be red and puffy. I started using hypo allergenic skin products and I have not had a problem since. I appreciated her help and it also relieved my mind that I did not have a serious problem with my immune system.. Basia excels in two areas. When Basia enters a new environment, she learns new talents, gains new skills and excels at them. Basia may have learned to shoot in basic training, but she perfected her skills in Colorado. She also has developed excellent skills in archery, hiking, snowboarding and canoeing while living in Colorado. Basia is also a very decisive person. It is a talent to look at a situation, know the right solution to a problem and follow through with the solution. With every challenge she has been presented, Basia has been able to apply her skills to achieve excellencies.. The first true feat of strength I can remember, that my wife accomplished, was her graduation from college. Though nay-sayers told her that her degree would be useless, it was important to her to follow the path that she had laid out before herself and follow it through to its fruition. She had a dream that her degree would lead her to the kind of life that she would like to live, and nothing would stop her from it. Working part time, in a demanding cancer research facility, while maintaining a full class schedule. During this time she also met, and married me. During this time, I never felt I was not important or cared for. The time spent we spent together was not by any means minimal so to accomplish a degree, while working, and loving me, while also always defending her decision to be with me to her family, is by no means a small accomplishment and true testament in strength and endurance on her part.. I would say Basia’s next true accomplishment in strength was also another one of endurance and patience. I was involuntarily recalled to active duty after she had been sent to her first duty station at Peterson AFB. For one year, she would be by herself. This year was difficult at work for her. learning every aspect of her AFSC. Navigating the Air Force customs, traditions, and workplace nuances that each shop builds with every task given, and accomplishment achieved, while learning to cope with workplace relationships. I would say she handled all of these things gracefully. The only support at home being a phone call to me once or twice a day, and conversations with my parents. Time and distance can stress any person and relationship. Basia’s strength and fortitude did not let this trial ruin our relationship but forged a stronger one instead.. Basia has had many more stories of strength in the last twelve years of our relationship. Overcoming personal loss. Nearly dying to give birth to our son. Teaching hundreds of students to become the best stewards of public health and safety. The most relevant to this occasion would be, the story she is still writing right now. Applying for, and following through with officer training has been, I think the most trying, and stressful experience of her life. Many nights of sleep have been lost to a possible brain tumor found during her entrance physical. The months spent studying for her entrance exam, the waiting that occurred for a year and a half from the time the application was submitted to actual officer training. And let’s not forget the actual training. For her training is still in progress. For everyone who watched her apply and leave for it. TSgt Rucker has already become 2nd Lt. Rucker. No one doubts that this trial is just a small stepping stone in the path that she has laid, for what will be an amazing and accomplished life. This stepping stone was flat and carefully and thoughtfully placed, and will be tread upon safely.. Our first introduction into Basia’s world was when we went to her college graduation in San Diego. We met her family at the graduation, very supportive and friendly. Following was a party in her honor. She is a first borne generation Polish to the country. The party was in an active Polish Community Center. The friends and family were mostly Polish and spoke both languages well including Basia. They were all very welcoming and curious about us and family. We were introduced to the food as well as the culture. Basia was making sure all were having fun and involved. She definitely has the community support. That does not occur by accident.. Not knowing what to expect, and wanting some father daughter time. I invited Basiato go scouting for elk one weekend for the coming year hunt. Her preparation included asking questions regarding the activity. The week before the weekend she made sure she had appropriate clothing, scent masking spray, optics, day pack essentials. Eagar for the experience we left on our day trip. Arriving at the base of the mountain, we unloaded the ATV to get up near the tree line (elevation 10,000ft)from there we hike. The trail was steep and rough. Looking for elk activity and sign of elk tracks, we pass through high mountain meadows, treacherous boulders fields with cliffs along the side dropping several hundred feet. Any mistake here could be fatal. Reaching the base of the highest point with only sheer granite cliffs and peaks reaching for the sky. We now are in elk country with lush meadows for food and glacier ponds for water. The tracks are plentiful. They have been here. We can see what direction they have traveled from. Basia had to adapt to beautiful but dangerous conditions with no modern conveniences. Not once did she loose interest. Always a student, emulating what she was taught. When she was at the cliffs crossing the boulder fields and driving the ATV she was cautious and making good decisions on the path direction.. Basia’s commitment to the USAF is nothing short of being honorable and amazing. Her eye has always been to be an officer even from the time she was in the college ROTC program. I watched her when they lived here and train for the physicals running mile after mile. Be-friending co-workers in many activities including climbing14,000ft mountains with some of them. Then she competed AFB athletic events and winning or with a very respectable showing. I was amazed the time and effort and great personal sacrifice to perform in the HONOR GUARD for the fallen soldiers. She is supported and loved by her husband and son in every way possible. Most of all, we are all better for having her in our lives.. When Barbara is at her best, she is helping others. I’ve known Barbara since the 10thgrade. She was my friend during some of the darkest moments in my life, when I was very sick and when my father passed away. She was my friend when I dropped out of college and when I returned and graduated. When I decided to move to New York City for grad school ten years ago, she cheered me on and remained a constant source of encouragement and laughter through my early years of city life. Barbara has always been a good listener, providing insights and other ways to look at situations and think outside of the box. Her creativity is paralleled by her ability to stay grounded and focused on the things that matter. She is dedicated to her family and friends. She is patient, supportive and always looked out for the best way to help you, specifically. She has been a rock for me in so many moments. In this way, she is a treasure to have as a friend.. When Barbara is at her best, she is excelling. She is going the extra mile to make sure that the job gets done. Her work ethic and her attention to detail are extraordinary. Others would simply want to do the minimum to pass by but Barbara works hard to exceed your expectations. I’ve known her since Junior ROTC days and remember fondly how motivated she was to be on the drill team and rifle team. We went to school every morning at 6 am to practice unarmed drill team. Then, afterschool, we had different ROTC competitions and she was the top female marksman for the entire district. Barbara is focused and committed to doing her utmost be stand that led to her being named the cadet commander for 13 San Diego JROTC schools.. When Barbara is at her best, she is inspiring others. Barbara leads by example and with a positive tone. By doing this, she motivates others to do well for themselves and the team. She knows how to be direct and how to be tactful in different situations and with different kinds of people. Although we went to different colleges, I remember how Barbara inspired others during JROTC years. Barbara has a strong sense of duty and courage both professionally and personally. I have spent many occasions with her parents, older brother, and younger sister, and I have admired her personal strength to be a role model and friend in good and bad times. She has overcome many hurdles in her professional life as well and has done this with such grace that others might underestimate her determination. I remember how she worked diligently with her research lab while taking a full load of courses, and whence decided to enlist in the Air Force, I knew her choice was the best one. She wanted to serve her country, do what was best for her young family, and serve her fellow military personnel the best way she knew how to. Barbara is a gem to have in one's personal and professional sphere. She inspires me professionally and personally.",19

He was an only child and did not come from an extensive family, so most of his family experiences consisted of he and his mother, Penny. Naturally, this put Josh in a position in where he had to grow up quickly and assume the responsibility of “man of the house” much sooner than the average American child should. When he departed for the military at age 18, he was already groomed in figuring out life tasks with less resources than most of his peers; this was undoubtedly a result of learning from his mother, as she performed double-duty in the parent world, as well as being introduced to a higher level of independence at such a young age. Despite spending most of his life without a father figure, Josh became a positive role model for kids who were missing a positive male influence in their lives. Working with a “big brother/sisters” organization via his church, Josh was able to pass along his own knowledge, experience, stories, and ethics to children in need of guidance and mentorship. Though Josh suffered a loss at a young age, he was able to channel this trial and use the energy toward something positive and fight for the greater good.. The Moral Compass I believe it was New Year’s Eve, 2008, when my friends and I decided to celebrate the occasion downtown at a local night club. It was a pretty normal party until one of our friends ended the evening with too much to drink. This friend had separated from the group while in an emotional state and remained gone for the rest of the evening. The remaining friends and I split up to look for this friend, but we never found her. I remember thinking, “This person is a grown up, she made her choice, she can take care of herself. She’s probably at home anyway.” I proceeded to take a taxi home and call it a night. Upon making it home, I called Josh to wish him a happy New Year and tell him about the night’s activities. Rather than sharing a laugh, this was his response: “You mean you lost a friend downtown in the middle of the night who was under the influence and you still can’t get a hold of her? WHY ARE YOU IN YOUR LIVING ROOM RIGHTNOW AND NOT OUT LOOKING FOR HER? WHY ARE YOU NOT CALLING EVERY POLICEDEPARTMENT, DETOX FACILITY, AND HOSPITAL IN TOWN? ""He was right. My moral compass had taken a night off while his was still on the clock. Furthermore, I had made the mistake of leaving an Airman behind and it took a 2-minute phone lecture from Josh on New Year’s Eve to make me come to my senses. After roughly an hour of calling around the city, I had finally found this friend at a detox facility. She looked like death, but she was okay. If I would have had the same mindset as Josh that evening, maybe this whole thing could have been avoided. I was given a wake-up call that night, so thank you Josh.. Persistence (Never give up!)Josh and I have followed each other among assignments for most of our careers. We were dorm rats together in 2001 when stationed at Schriever AFB, then both went to Buckley AFB, then both got assigned to Vandenberg AFB, and both independently decided to pursue Officer Training School at the same time. We were both older than the average applicant, so time was against us. The first board in which we applied, we were both passed over. Six months later, we applied again; I made it, Josh did not. After doing the math, he calculated he was beyond the age to feasibly make the cutoff of the next board he could apply for. This was discouraging to me, as we had always been the unspoken Wingmen for each other, subconsciously connected. I started asking around, looking for loopholes...Age waivers were not being accepted. My contacts, both peers and leadership, said there was no chance. Even the questionnaire in the Officer Training School application basically said, “CEASE ALL ACTIONS AND SHRED THIS DOCUMENT.” Odds were against this guy. And then the son-of-a-bitch did it. He applied again and made it. Despite the age issue, the people saying it was impossible, and even the application guidance, Josh trusted his gut and believed in himself. He was either really smart or really crazy –either way, it is the type of person I want in my officer corps.. Josh, I am not a strong believer in self-help / how-to leadership books, but I have borrowed a passage from John Maxwell over the past several years...principally, because I admire and believe in the sentiment. I’m sharing this with you, because you “do it” (add value) so well. Let this continue to be a model for your daily interactions with those you lead...and follow: ""The interaction between every leader and follower is a relationship, and all relationships either add to or subtract from a person’s life. If you are a leader, then trust me, you are having either a positive or a negative impact on the people you lead. How can you tell? There is one critical question: Are you making things better for the people who follow you? That’s it. If you cannot answer with an unhesitant yes, and give some evidence that backs it up, then you may very well be a subtractor. Often subtractors don’t realize they are subtracting from others. I would say that 90percent of all people who subtract from others do so unintentionally. They don't recognize their negative impact on others. And when a leader is a subtractor and doesn't change his ways, it’s only a matter of time before his impact on others goes from subtraction to division. I contrast, 90 percent of all people who add value to others do so intentionally, Why do I say that? Because human beings are naturally selfish. I’m selfish. Being an adder requires me to get out of my comfort zone every day and think about adding value toothers. But that’s what it takes to be a leader who others want to follow. Do that long enough, and you not only add value to others—you begin to multiply it.”. Josh, your confidence and courage to assume additional responsibility and challenge inspires all those around you. Not so much for the mere fact that you do it, but that you do it with the success of loyalty, grace and humility. There is no better example or manifestation of this than you accepting and stepping up as the Division Superintendent and then AOC First Sergeant. Leader decisions to fill these critical positions are not made lightly - they are deliberate and made principally on the demonstration of how well you selflessly care for others on behalf of the organization and, more intrinsically, your own desire/motivation to help others.. Josh, continue to let Megan, first, and music shine in and through your life. Both provide evidence of who and what defines you as a person and a leader. Always strive to make Megan and music priorities even when the Air Force attempts to tell/dictate to you otherwise. Better yet, continue to find those unique opportunities to blend personal and professional interests, goals, and priorities — NOBODY, I know, does this better than you! What an honor to know Josh and Megan Tarrant.. Not long after Josh married my daughter, I was visiting them in Colorado Springs. They chose a very nice Italian restaurant to take me to the night before I flew back home. We happened to have terrible service that night. Not one, but many instances of poor service and poor attitude. Josh was very upset and called quietly for a manager. He then asked the manager to step outside the area where there were no customers. He then calmly but firmly told the manager what had gone on and how important a night this was planned to be and how disappointed we were in the whole experience. I was so proud of this young man and the way he handled a very bad situation. In the end he was given tremendous compensation for our lost evening and a guarantee that this would never happen again. I knew at that moment that my daughter would always have a champion and not a bully........ When Josh was in Tops in Blue travelling all over the world for the Air Force as a drummer he had an accident one night while changing sets/changing clothes. He tripped up a staircase and landed on his hand. He didn't miss a beat that night nor any other performance even though after X-ray it was revealed that he had broken a bone in his hand. For the rest of the tour he adjusted what he was doing and didn't 'miss a beat'. I believe that this speaks to his ability to work through adversity and obstacles and find solutions.. When Josh was working for a private contractor in Boulder for the Air Force he volunteered to plan and execute the Christmas Party for the company. He, in essence, became an Event Planner. He pulled off what they all said was the best party they had ever attended. (And just to make it clear that the fun wasn't dependent on how much anyone drank). He accomplished this by having the restaurant (Italian) make stations around the room where they could help themselves to things....or watch their pizza dough being tossed in the air etc. He also had them arrange the tables in long lines so everyone would be together instead of separate tables of 4.....I'm sure there were many details I have left out but it takes a strong type of leader to pull something like this together and have it be talked about around the water cooler for weeks!!. Josh has determination and never gives up. One example of this was when he broke his wrist/fingers on the Tops In Blue tour. Being a drummer, the only drummer, would have severely degraded our show had he not played. Sure we could have found are placement but not one in enough time to learn the music and not one as good as he is. Josh played through it! I'm sure he was in pain but never let us down.. Josh is a great leader! As a flight chief he took care of his people by making sure their evaluations were written well and in a timely manner. One of his strengths is communication and I believe he did a great job of knowing his people well enough that he could write fair and just evaluations.. Josh was invited to be a team leader at the Tops In Blue Worldwide Talent Competition. He helped the instrumentalist prepare for their show night. His valuable insight helped the Chief of Air Force Entertainment to make decisions on who should or should not tour the next year. Josh can always be relied on to give an honest opinion. This is something that is lacking in today's Air Force. I believe he will make a great officer.. When Josh's father passed away, Josh tried to take on the role of ""the man of the house"". During the next several months Josh was more protective of me than any young man (age 15) would normally be.. When Josh was 16 years old he was working (with a workers permit) and saving his money. He saved enough to buy his own car. His employer felt he was an extremely responsible worker and always willing to do more than his share of work that needed to be done.. When Josh was stationed more than half way across the country, the most horrific tragedy happened to our country. I was terrified that his part of the country could be targeted by these horrible people. In a phone conversation with Josh I, out of the blue, said ""maybe I should move out to where you are"". There was dead silence for a few seconds after which I heard the words ""I would love that"". So I did just that and he was just as attentive as any mother could have asked for. He actually flew east and drove me out there and when I felt satisfied that he had established a very nice and productive life for himself, I decided I wanted to move back home and he took the time to drive me back which was a 32 hour drive. I could never have hoped to have a son as well grounded, thoughtful, ambitious and focused as Josh and I could not be any prouder of him.. I met Josh in 2011 and have known his character and the impact he has on others since day one. Josh immediately struck me as an honest, hard-working, always punctual, and accountable man; many times he was the only one of ‘our group 'consistently representing these traits. He is always considerate of others and inspires his friends to be their best self. I specifically recall a time that Josh was the drummer in my spouse’s band, which consisted of 4 guys in their late-20’s; I had joined them for a local show. Josh was always the first one at the venue, never an exception, and always prepared to give his best at this “job”– he took it seriously when the others often times did not. At this particular show, Josh clearly was frustrated by his bandmates' habit of being late and he chose to speak with them about their lack of care and its effect on others. I saw him impact the other band members that day, encouraging them to be respectful and take things seriously at this “job”. When others are counting on you, or if you’ve committed to something, you follow-through. I've witnessed this side of Josh in everything he does for the past 6+ years. His accountability, commitment, respect – they make him an excellent leader to all those he is in contact with.. I apologize but I cannot think of another specific story. Josh is an excellent role model, especially to his peers, and I've personally experienced a change in my spouse based on time they’ve spent together. He has an incredible gift, being able to lead other and his relentless determination for achieving his goals is truly inspiring.",17

She truly sees the bright side of every circumstance and takes an active role in being that way. She doesn’t hide or claim not to have her own life struggles, but she actively works through those issues and finds a way to turn them into something positive. I will never forget just chit chatting about life in general and I started talking about the death of my husband and the ups and downs of grief as she stood in the doorway of my office. She not only listened to me, but shared her own life experiences and through the discussion, she specifically talked about how we can control how we perceive what’s happening around us. She didn’t know this at the time, but after I thought a lot about what she said and how she applied this mindset to her own life, I was finally able to see some of the growth through my tragedy and how it was impacting others around me in a good way. Forcing our minds to think in a certain way is not easy, but it was Kate’s positive outlook and her genuineness that really has stuck with me through the years.. Kate has the most incredible time management skills. When we first started working together she was not only an NCO, but an expectant mother. She juggled her job, her new life as a mom, and still managed to kill it at fitness and took on just about every job at the squadron that was available. She didn’t kill herself working 15 hour days, but rather she set priorities, made no excuses, and worked hard during the duty day. Fitness, specifically is incredibly important to her. She didn’t just give up because she had a new baby at home. She found creative ways to get her workouts in. One time, she posted a video of when Brielle had finally gone to sleep and so she took the baby monitor onto the porch and worked out in whatever time her baby would allow her. She never used being a new mom as an excuse, but showcased how to modify your workouts based on your current health status in order to reach your goals. Her commitment to fitness (in a healthy and safe manner) is what led the Commander to name the unit gym after her! At work she was destroying additional duties to include running the booster club, and dorm manager outside of her normal forecasting job with very little guidance. She also made time to help others around her with their projects etc. Kate is a true leader among her peers.. Kate does not fear failure. She recognizes the opportunity in any situation even if she is unsure of her ability to complete the task or project. She was put in charge of getting a team out the door to the National Training Center where the army trains for combat. The unit had become so lax in doing the planning and preparation through the years of high deployments, that it was noted certain tasks were not getting done before hand anymore. Kate took on the project of developing letters of instruction, pre and post deployment checklists, and ensuring a robust continuity was up to date for all the new Airmen coming into the unit. She didn’t have all the answers, but she took the project head on leveraging her own experience, the experience of others around her and researching the data directly with the army units. She did all of this without requiring someone to give her specific tasks or to micromanage it. This is her attitude with anything she takes on. If she doesn’t know how to do something she actively figures it out and then comes on line when she hits a road block for help. She's never afraid that she will fail, but is willing to tackle any challenge in order to learn something from it or to ensure it helps the next Airmen behind her.. Catherine's Strengths.....Wow where to start! Well she is strong and not just physically, but mentally, emotionally and Spiritually. She is the very definition of Strength. Now I won't fill this space with dictionary definitions. But if you do look it up, reading it paints in my mind the very image I see when I think of Kate. I don't think I could pick just three events in which she's displayed an above average amount of strength. I believe that everything she does she does it wholeheartedly and at 150%. For the many years that I have known her she's always been the one you know you can count on with a big smile that instantly reminds you of how great life is. Her strength is that she has the potential to do what she sets her mind to and does it with a smile on her face because she sees every new experience as a possibility. That's what makes her Special and Beloved and most importantly Family.. To know Kate is to love her. She is always cheerful and sunny even in the face of adversity or personal crisis. She is the most beautiful person I know inside and out. So much so that even writing about how awesome she is makes me emotional. Because I miss her. See we just pcsed out a few months ago. And even though we are ten years In and have moved about half a dozen times, Making Good Friends, well that is hard to do when you move so often. She has been my best friend for years now and even our little girls are best friends. And we grew so close that we are now all family. So I think of her with very high regard not just because I love her but because she is an amazing person. And will make you feel just as amazing. Honestly I think if it's not Broke don't fix it. And she is far from broke when it comes to Strength she has it coming out of her ears. And I know that she knows that if she is ever in need and really looking for inspiration to strengthen her, Her Strength is about 3fttall, calls her mommy and has a smile just as beautiful as her mother's. And while on the subject of being a mother, lets talk about Kate's welcome into Motherhood. She was the loveliest preggy lady. You couldn't help but smile when you would see her. From the start it was an unexpected journey. She not only developed an emergency medical condition brought on by pregnancy, But she needed to have an emergency surgery to deliver her baby girl about 4 weeks early to save them both. Talk about a crash course into Motherhood. A routine preggy check up turned into "" baby time. ""And anyone knows that preparing for a baby is especially overwhelming. Now imagine that instead of trying to figure out where to go for lunch you're planning for your baby to arrive. Now that takes strength. And not only because instead of lunch she was having a baby but because she would also have to have surgery instead of labor naturally. That's a  LOT to take in all at once. But I can imagine that for the sake of the baby, probably her sanity and Shane she was calm cool and collected, because that's Kate. Calm in a crisis, levelheaded and most importantly I think, proactive. She's not a spectator in life or sport. She is more active than anyone I know, is a good sport if called for. She is willing to do what is needed for her own good and especially for the good of others. We are the generation that cares. And Kate she cares! She cares a lot for others. She puts others before herself in true leadership form. She is giving and willing to give you the help you ask for. She will not only do that but always go above and beyond. When she does something she does it with all her heart and That Girl has a Very Big Heart.. I've always believed in mind over matter. That the brain is the strongest muscle in your body and that if you put your mind to it there is literally and physically nothing you Can't do. I had a strong positive influence in my life for me it was my father for Kate her mom. Now I never had the pleasure of meeting her myself. I know Leona thru Kate's eyes. And the same Strength and compassion and caring she shows in her every day life is a direct example of the Wonderful mother she had. If anyone was setting an example of being strong not in spite of what you're going through but because of it. It would be her mom. I know how much she loves her mama. Now I think her mom would agree with me as well, that she is an amazing mother, A GREAT friend and yes a Strong Amazing Person. So asking for Kate's strengths is like asking Pi for a number there are a whole lot of them & you can have your pick and not ever be disappointed. :)We love you K!. Kate has a unique ability to make every person she meets feel appreciated and valued. As a junior, I transferred high schools and I distinctly remember not only her warm welcome but also how she flawlessly maneuvered between a variety of social groups and maintained relationships with her peers. To navigate the social waters in high school while excelling in a variety of activities including cheerleading, performing arts and honors classes highlights her emotional intelligence. Sometimes people skills cant be taught, and Kate has the ability to bring out the best in people no matter their skills or interests and develop genuine relationships with them.. I remember reading the news that Kate's mom had passed. I recall both the grace and vulnerability Kate exhibited, both speaking to her ability to understand emotions(of others and her own), but also take a very sad situation and turn it into something positive and bring light to the darkness surrounding death. She was able to ask for assistance from her unit, request emergency leave, etc. in a dire time of emotional stress and was gracious for the support she received. She leaned on people when she needed to, and when ready charged a Susan G Komen Race for the Cure event in her mother's honor. Kate often references the relationship she had with her mom and the life lessons that were instilled and she lives those values out to this day.. Kate is a caretaker who also understands the value of self-care. As a mom, Kate thrives. The joy and glee on her daughter's face radiates a mutual loving relationship between mom and daughter. Kate fosters a sense of exploration, imagination, strength and self-sufficiency in her daughter, highlighted by the flexing princess that Brielle is - I think that's the essence of how Kate is able to care for someone while letting them explore and develop in their own way. In addition to motherhood, Kate was a dorm manager, Victim's advocate, and is a super-volunteer, all highlighting her dedication to other people and their needs. This is also highlighted in her successful personal physical training business. She carefully crafts plans dedicated to the unique needs of her clients and sets them up for success and independent implementation of the plan. But, Kate is also aware of the importance of self-care, and understands the balance between taking care of others and herself. Her gym time is ""her"" time and despite a variety of physical setback where others would say ""I'll do it when I'm healed or feel better"" Kate adapted physical fitness so that her ""me"" time would not be too adversely impacted (of course all with approval from a doc and smartly, but still figured out a way for her self-care needs to get met). Wags has developed command and control through physical toughness. When I first met Wags she was very quiet, she never raised her voice for anything that I’m aware of. Over the 5 years I knew her she challenged herself physically each passing year. By the time I PCS’d she had become the ultimate Battlefield Airmen/woman. She was always the first pick (if available) to represent the unit for warrior challenges against TACP Airmen. When we had unit ruck marches, she would run the entire way whether it was 3 or 6 miles...with a smile on her face. I dared once to challenge her, at the 1mile marker she had already caught me, when she passed she cheerfully, not arrogantly, said “good morning Sgt Mitchem,” I never tried to beat her again, she destroyed any ego I had left of myself that day. The crowning moment when I knew she had developed command and control was toward the end of a squadron PT session. After leading us in a grueling stadium sprint session, she made us drop on our faces for “planks”. As we sat there in position, struggling to reach a 60 second plank, most of the unit started to arch their backs. Wags was not having it, she yelled with the voice of a BMT TI, “GET YOUR BUTTS OUT OF THE AIR!!!” Everyone, SqCommander included, knew who was the Boss of us all and immediately followed her command. I was so proud of her that morning.. Wags is a very bright and humble person. She’s takes advantage of educational opportunities to improve herself. She completed a challenging tropical weather course, bachelors, masters and is working on her PH.D, (she may have completed it).Yet with all the knowledge she has gained, she still seeks wisdom from others that may not have such high accolades. She realizes that knowledge can come from many sources and that learning is a lifelong pursuit. She seeks out performance feedback then excels ones expectations. These are important attributes to have as a leader, one that is educated yet will listen to advice from those that have applicable life experiences before making her final decision. Through her educational endeavors she has mastered time management and organizational skills.. Wags is mentally tough to conquer challenges that stand in her way...yet she knows when she has to take a knee. July 2015, I was on leave. I got a text that she had been in an accident and that she was ok. To me, it sounded like it was a fender bender and nothing significant to worry about. A couple hours later she sent me picture texts of her Ford Focus, it looked like a crushed coke can. She had a head on collision with a800 lbs. cow, it fell directly into her windshield and was probably a few inches away from being crushed herself, yet to her it was like nothing happened. I know she felt bad because the cow had to be put down. When I got back from leave she still had to get her gym time in to work out. I had to intervene and remind her that she had a concussion, her leg was jacked up and to take a knee on this. Though I know it bothered her, she took the knee to heal. Another story to illustrate her mental fortitude is when she had to man the fort, while her ex-husband had to deploy for 6months leaving her with a baby. Her child had a few health battles and I know Wags had long days and short nights, but she overcame that battle as a single, new mom with grace. Mental toughness is required of leaders to overcome barriers, or find other ways to accomplish the mission when the path is not certain or dotted with hazards....like cows.. Catherine Wagner, Kate, is a kind, caring, and compassionate person. Since I have known her, Kate has always tried to help people. This might be as simple as smiling at someone, giving money to someone, or talking to someone that most people avoid, all of which Kate does on a normal basis. One of Kate’s responsibilities at her previous unit was coordinate going away parties for Airmen. Even when Kate was assigned different tasks, being responsible for the barracks, she continued to head any going away parties. This was because she learned the next party was only going to have a cake and not other customs that have become synonymous with the tradition. I asked Kate why she cared what this Airman thought. Her response was that everyone deserves feel special, and something like this could go a long way for reenlistment further down the road. Kate spent her free time making a fake newspaper to read at the gathering, which the Airman specifically requested. This is just one example of the compassion that Kate has for everyone.. Catherine Wagner, Kate, has a unique strength of being able to read and understand people like no one else I have ever met. Kate is able to put herself in someone else's place and follow her moral compass to always do the best thing, even when that means doing something she does not benefit from. For the last year and a half, Kate has talked to me about her decision regarding if she should get divorced or not. We have talked about Kate’s and her daughter’s feelings, like most people; however, Kate has also thought about her husband’s feelings and everything he might go through. I think most people would have left a relationship, even with a child, if something was wrong and a change was not happening. Kate has sacrificed herself because she understands how this would have affected other people. There is no one else that I know, or might even see in a movie, who would have sacrificed so much.. Catherine Wagner, Kate, is by far the most dedicated person I have ever met. I first met Kate at the gym. I would always see Kate working out at different times. It didn't matter if it was 5AM, lunch time, or late at night, it seemed like whenever I was working out, so was Kate. I later found out that Kate works out when she gets the chance. That might mean she has to get up super early in the morning, wait until lunch, or go after her kid falls asleep. Working out is a priority for Kate, but this priority comes after others, such as being a mother, a wife, her job, and being a friend to everyone. This might mean that she would have to go two different times in a day just to finish her workout. This dedication is not just in the gym. There have been multiple times where I would be talking to Kate about things going on in my life, just to realize that time had gotten away. Kate would tell me, after we were done talking, that she had things for work, or friends, that she still needed to do that night, but as always she was waiting until after her daughter fell asleep. Kate will sacrifice herself to accomplish everything in a manner that makes one think that she put100% of her focus and attention into that one item. The truth though, Kate puts this effort into anything that she does.. Her strength is truth. Where she picked up, this value, is her's and her's alone. She was sitting in my home once and we talked and she said I will never lie to you, and afterwards...to this day she has spoken only truth to me. How rare is this? Its very rare, and yet looking back she shined brighter because of it and my trust she's never failed.. As her Pops, I have been able to watch her grow: And one night while she was lead in a high school musical, I ran backstage at intermission to tell her how awesome an actress she is. When I got back there she was reading lines for the next scene. She explained that she missed a practice and wanted to read through this one part. I quickly said my peace and left, but walked back to my seat marvelling at her commitment and the musical I knew well and no one missed a line or a cue. She didn't know that that one, was a favorite of mine. That has always stuck with me, as if frozen in time as an example to make good use of one's time.. One memory stands out with her brother Adam who needed financial and morale support and Kate came to the rescue, and later on he needed more help which she gave again wisely. These are often not a popular view, to 'give wisely.' Yet, to give in this manner violates no one. To give assistance can come in many forms, yet which form is best? The answer is easy, just ask Kate she has grown through her experiences.. The most recent and continuous display of the great strength of Catherine is the impact she clearly has on others, and often times others that haven't even met her. Through her social media alone you see what she does to inspire, help, and coach veterans and/or fitness enthusiasts. The amount of selflessness that goes into what she does on a daily basis is immediately apparent and clearly appreciated by the lives she touches. She puts a lot of hard work into helping others while juggling her career, her duties and responsibilities, and also being a parent. In the midst of a busy lifestyle there is never a time Catherine is unavailable if she's needed, and will stop what shes doing to help anyone for any reason. Catherine is a huge inspiration and has the character and values many people strive to obtain. She's the epitome of ""hard work pays off"" and has earned every bit of success she has. It's an amazing thing to see, and has her brother I couldn't be more proud.. In 2008, we lost our mother due to illness. In the midst of the shock, sadness etc. Catherine was the one to step up and assume the role as sort of the anchor for us siblings. It was no easier on her than any of us but she maintained the stable footing and clear head to help us through this rough time. Whether it was advice needed or an ear to listen she always had time to talk and be there for us. In that time she was a mentor, counsellor, and best friend. Even now almost 10 years later this still holds true. I know I can speak for my other siblings in saying we all reach out to Catherine if we need someone to talk to before we call on any of the others. She didn't intend on jumping in to the role as the family's ""mother"" so to speak but she does it well and provides the comfort and advice needed to get through difficult time.. Seeing all of Catherine's strengths come out at one time is seeing her as a teacher, and more specifically, a parent. The patience, support, and words of wisdom she provides is nothing short of what every mother should do and/or strive to do. She's astern woman with a warm heart. Her selflessness and leadership qualities shine through her daughter. There doesn't seem to be anything that can break her spirits and she's always got a clear head and her feet beneath her. Catherine is an outstanding role model and is nothing but a symbol of strength and stability.. One Story that I think shows some insight into who she is as a leader or one conversation we had was about giving people tasks to do at work in relation to her BCT team. She was very hesitant to give more of her team members tasks to do because she wanted them done right and for that reason did them herself. We talked about developing people, and soon she changed her mindset. I noticed very quickly that she was an extremely hard worker, and wanted all tasks done to her standard of perfection. That’s really the only story I have in regard to her as a leader. Otherwise she is a tremendous leader, and a superstar.",22

One time Ed came in on AT (Annual Training) and redid the entire Intelligence Oversight Program. He did a pretty good job. I think he is very good at organizing things. Ed is very good a being self-motivated. I have always questioned his selflessness but he does in fact have a good heart. He will sit and talk with people and do his best to counsel folks on the best path forward. Ed has been known to always be juggling several things and he does a great job of that sometimes. I notice that he is in fact more successful than me in a lot of aspects so maybe I am the one who has something to learn from him. He is perhaps a great success; his conservative values and defense of the free market are very good and he lives them rather than talking about them.. Ed likes efficiency. As an enlisted man I admire that and he was an enlisted man for along time. He even attended SNCO Academy weeks before TFOT in an attempt to get the most efficiency out of his leadership lessons and the Air Force paid for both. Either one is necessary but both was above and beyond.. Ed and I discussed several topics in the past. His briefing skills are amazing. I have always admired his “candor” during guard-drill. One time he even suggested we recite the Air Force Creed in an attempt to bring pride and espirit de corps to the shop. It got mixed reviews; but in his defense it was a brave attempt.. Ed, from the first time we went when I was the Grand Knight of our Knights of Columbus council, and you were seeking membership, you impressed me as being a very thoughtful and perceptive individual who was willing to help. Too often it was like pulling teeth to get brother Knights to volunteer so I was grateful to have you. In fact, when talking to those outside of the organization, I would sometimes refer to you as my “star” member. Whether it be in routine matters such as filling in for the Recording Secretary at meetings or more visible ways such as serving as the Lector at our annual Knights Memorial Mass, you readily agreed to do so. Perhaps most significantly, you accepted appointment as Lecturer, an officer position which involves devising means to entertain the council members at meetings. It was a perfect fit for you. Throughout your tenure in the position, you consistently provided the membership with well researched and expertly delivered presentations on all manner of subjects pertaining to our Order and faith, which were of great benefit to our members.. When I think of a particular moment when you were at your best, I would have to say that would be at the time of your mother’s death last year. It is never easy to lose a loved one, especially a parent. However much we dread it, of course we anticipate that one day we will have to bury our parents. But, one is never truly prepared when that day comes. This is especially true in situations like with your mother when the illness is brief and death comes rather sudden. Although grieving the loss of your mother, you quietly and confidently led your family in planning and coordinating all of the funeral arrangements, which involved services in two different parishes in two different states. You even had the strength and composure to offer your own very poignant reminiscences of your mother at the funeral Mass, something that I didn't have the strength to do at my father’s funeral. In so doing, you honored your mother and set an example to other’s in how to cope with and conduct yourself at a most difficult time.. Another moment when I feel you were at your best is when you first were sent to Afghanistan as a civilian employee with the United States Department of Defense. I can't imagine what it must have been like to be so far away in such a dangerous place and the conditions you had to endure. I recall that before you left you were told that, depending where you were housed, you might even have to utilize unisex bathrooms as is the practice with some of the allied countries that were also present. Although a bit apprehensive I’m sure, overall you appeared to take it all in stride and seemed determined to make the best of it. I remember being somewhat surprised when you contacted me via e-mail while in Afghanistan wanting to know how you and some of your Catholic colleagues could establish a Knights of Columbus council at your base. I found it remarkable that even though you must have had so many other things to concern yourself with, you were determined to maintain contact with our Order and by doing so strengthen your Catholic faith while oversees. By your manner and comportment throughout your deployment, you reflected well on your country and faith.. It gives me pleasure to provide this letter of reference for Lieutenant Edward Maurice. I have known Ed as a dear friend for over 10 yrs and observed many of his wonderful qualities. Whenever he has the opportunity, he is active within his community, church and non-profit organizations. There has been numerous occasions where Ed’s natural leadership skills have served him well, so I am glad he has chosen to enhance his skills further with Leadership Development School. His focus is in the current moment but his confidence is gained from seeing the end game. He is the type of leader who anticipates your needs, exceeds them and then advances ahead of them. Whether it was a simple task or ‘mission impossible’, he is always eager to empower and take charge. Reading habits along with being open-minded has made him become exceptionally insightful. Not only is he capable of attaining vast knowledge, he has the patience to share his wisdom. Ed’s impressive personal behavior and reliability are beyond reproach. I am confident his strong leadership skills and administrative ability will make him a key asset. Sincerely, Melvin Colins. Eds biggest strength is his organization abilities. Everything has a place and is expected to be in its place. When Ed and my daughter moved into their new home Ed organized every room, cabinet, and storage space to best suit their needs. Whenever anything is needed itis easily accessed because it is always kept organized. Things are rarely lost because things are always put away. We have all learned from Eds example.. Ed has great leadership abilities and it has been very useful to us during summer family vacations. One summer our entire family of eight traveled to Breckenridge, Colorado. Ed knew we could hike a fourteener as a family and assured us he would lead us. He gathered all maps, charts, and guide books to lead us up to the peak. We were all thrilled at the wonderful adventure and even paused for a family photo along one of the lakes we passed. Those that were capable of finishing the hike enjoyed seeing mountain goats, many beautiful lakes, and gorgeous views. A forever memory was etched into our minds.. Ed has a lot of compassion for others. His greatest experience has been to become a Father to his two sons, Eddie and Mikey. After the birth of his first son, Eddie, the Doctors became concerned that Eddie was not gaining enough weight to keep up with his height. Ed was so sorry that he couldn't help with the breast feeding but helped by using a feeding tube during breast feeding to add some extra formula nutrition. As soon as Eddie was old enough to eat solids Ed was right there to do the duty. A teach meal Ed counted how many spoonfuls Little Eddie had to eat before he was allowed out of his high chair. Eddie thrives even till this day and loves to eat because Ed insisted on Eddie eating fifteen spoonfuls at each meal.. Strength: Organization Edward is extremely organized. He has a network of all important files that can be accessed within the click of a mouse, thus making pertinent information accessible at any given moment. He has this information backed up on separate locations in case one is destroyed by a natural disaster or theft. Also the non secure information can be accessed via the cloud. Therefore when I need to quickly access information quickly to complete a task, Edwards file organization comes to the rescue. Getting passports, birth certificates, renewals, accounts updates all becomes way less taxing due to his organizational systems.. Strength: disaster readiness I can honestly say that if a fire occurred or a bugler invaded our home I feel I would at least have a plan. This is due to my husband disaster readiness mindset! He has made me partake in several mock drills, at first I scoffed at this notion. However due to working in health care and being involved in countless codes where seconds count, I understand the importance of this mindset. So on several occasions before he has deployed I have been part of a fire drill or exit strategy scenario. Thankfully I have not had to use this knowledge yet and hopefully I never will. However if I did I feel that I would be better prepared due to his proactive training and due diligence in minimizing the damage in a possibly disaster.. Strength: analysis and foresight Ed has the ability to take data or imagery and make it into a usable product. I say imagery because we had a tree doctor come out to our house and he had the foresight to print off a google earth image of our property and identified each and every tree we had in our yard. Now when a tree gets sick or has a insect infestation (we have lost several ash trees to the Ash Bore) we can access the key to access the tree information. His foresight and ability to uses the tools we had have streamlined information into a usable product for analysis .",13

Every single time we met Tyler came prepared with insightful reflections and thoughtful questions. I looked forward to these times each week in a way I normally don't - I think because of his eagerness to share what he was learning, how well he listens, and his sharp and insightful mind. I miss our weekly meetings.. Tyler served as a volunteer leader with Young Life, a Christian ministry focused on relational ministry with compassion and love to high school students. Tyler invested significant time in a work that is at times very difficult. He worked hard to ""earn the right to be heard"" with kids by spending time in their world in a non-judgmental way all the while maintaining his integrity and modelling a different way of living. He took vacation time in the summer to go with kids to camp for a week as a leader. Having worked for Young Life I know the value and the difficulty of finding quality volunteer leaders and I'm greatly impressed with Tyler's leadership, integrity, and ability to relate to all types of people with respect and love.. Our church hired Tyler as an intern in our worship arts department. It was an easy sell. Not only is Tyler extremely gifted musically (voice, guitar) but he also has great ""up-front"" presence. We are a large church and our up-front leadership needs to be sharp and lead with authenticity. Tyler excelled. When he announced he would be leaving for OTS we were thrilled for him but disappointed for us. He is a man of God that all of us at King Street Church believe has tremendous leadership gifts that he exercises with joy and humility.. Tyler, one thing I really respect about you is your determination, motivation and hard work. Specifically I'm thinking about your band White Like Fire. I struggle to have the discipline to write lyrics and music, but you always kept writing songs, knowing that it was ok if not every one was a smash hit. You spent hours writing, rehearsing, planning tours, working with agents because you were passionate about your creativity. You didn't let any setbacks or slow seasons totally discourage you from moving forward. Your perseverance to do the things you love is admirable.. I think another one of your strengths is your nearly unquenchable thirst for knowledge. I always loved seeing you dig deep to research and answer questions you had about anything, especially the difficult theological ones. I know you'll always be a lifelong learner and use your expansive knowledge base to help others and teach others what you've learned.. Finally, another strength of yours is relationally giving of yourself to others. I've so appreciated our friendship over the past years and your commitments to our hangouts in Pittsburgh and FaceTime's from across the state. I've also seen you pour in to other peer friendships, relationships at church, and into a younger generation. Keep spending your energy investing in others, even when it feels like you're not getting as much in return. You're a great friend.. Tyler Clawson is an excellent learner. He was an intern at church I serve at. It was our responsibility to make sure that he had experiences in all different facets of church worship so he was tasked with serving in many different capacities. For the most part he’d not had much experience in leading or planning worship services. Ashe took on each new responsibility he learned quickly the things he needed to do to accomplish each task. By the end of his internship he became an incredibly reliable and competent leader in our church both spiritually and musically. I attribute that to his skill of being an excellent learner.. Tyler Clawson values leadership and respects the roles of those around him. As one of his supervisors during his last internship he understood that his responsibility was be available and willing to serve in any capacity he was directed. While I feel most people with an amount of talent such as his might feel that they are too skilled to serve in that kind of role he took on each directive with a humble understanding that this was his role. He shows great respect to those above him by being ready to be directed to serve in any role he was asked. He has an excellent work ethic and is able to handle large amounts of responsibility while not losing any attention to detail.. Tyler Clawson is a great friend. He is completely dependable. Our friendship has been transformative to my marriage and to my other relationships. He does not take serving one another lightly. I believe he is an excellent example of someone who can see someone’s fullest potential and encouraging them to take steps to achieve that potential without compromising that relationship. He would be a great asset to any type of team dealing with strategic matters because he is thoughtful and not quick to make decisions based off emotions. He is rational.. In 2013 Tyler demonstrated great endurance and selflessness while working and living in Pittsburgh. He shared an apartment with his band, in which he sacrificially took the smallest room, hardly large enough to fit a mattress in. From this closet, Tyler would rise early in the morning to walk the city streets in the snow to work all day at a job that was of no relation to his interests or abilities. He took this job to help raise money for his band, of which he bore the creative burden and pressure. The job was filled with menial and thankless tasks, operating at a call center for a consulting firm. He did it with such aplomb that he had a positive impact on his coworkers, making friends and improving the work environment. Walking home every evening he would return to his apartment to write songs and endure the challenges inherent in putting oneself “out there” for the world to criticize in the performing arts. Tyler demonstrated great patience, work ethic, self-reliance, and self-sacrifice during this time.. Tyler has an uncanny impact on everyone he meets. Whether it is at work, in volunteering, or in social situations he leaves people with a positive impression that inspires them to seek him out for his time and effort. This singular attitudinal impact Tyler carries with him has benefited those around him at University, philanthropic efforts in Romania and the United States, music performance on national stages, ministry, and honest friendships. Tyler has never entered a church, without sooner or later being discovered as a talent and ushered into leadership. Tyler has never held a job at which employer’s did not regret to see him leave as he pursued other goals. Tyler has never had a friend whose life couldn’t be touched by his honesty and compassion. I worked alongside Tyler for several years, and when it came to having candid personal conversation with supporters or colleagues in music, Tyler was the one we relied on. It is a unique gift to resonate so deeply with the intangibles of human interaction, and to have such a deep interest in human experience and conditions.. Being good under pressure is a conundrum to recognize. Some individuals might claim this attribute, yet perform poorly when held to the test. Others, may not enjoy pressure but, do their best work during trial and tribulation. Tyler is the of the latter mold. In college he worked a job while pulling all nighters for a major that was both mathematical and creative. He had to not only learn the techniques of architecture and drafting, but also tap into the intangibles of personal taste and subjectivity that would factor into his grades and reviews. Tyler was the leader of a band that started playing shows in basements, and ended performing for the MLB. He overcame nervousness, sleeplessness, and pressure to compete on stage for the hearts of modern discerning audiences. He would sleep in a van at rest stops during the night, and attend meetings in Manhattan with entertainment moguls during the day. When other men are satisfied with a day job, Tyler’s pursuits are tackled with every ounce of enthusiasm and energy he can muster. For him, pressure yields his greatest output.. During college, I did not have a car to get me to and from my hometown for the holidays. Tyler was willing to drive to pick me up and drive me home which was around trip of 6 hours. He took the time to do something inconvenient and time consuming. He saw this as an opportunity to help another person and this action did not go unnoticed.. After grocery shopping, an elderly woman backed into Tyler's car. Many in this situation would become angry and short-tempered. Tyler handled this situation in a calm and collected way. He checked both his car and the woman's car and saw that no damage was done. Due to this, he assured the woman that everything was okay and they could go their separate ways. The woman was thankful for him being understanding and taking charge of the situation. Tyler is able to address chaotic situations in a level-headed, safe and efficient manner.. I am currently in graduate school which requires me to complete fieldwork experiences. I have no control over where I am placed for my fieldwork experience and my most recent experience was in the city which required me to parallel park. The amount of panic I had to overcome the intense fears of driving in the city and having to parallel park was immense. Tyler was there for me to not only calm me down with my anticipated fear but to practice and teach me how to parallel park. He practiced with me countless times in a variety of situations until I felt I was ready. He showed patience, guidance and great teaching skills as I conquered this fear. He encouraged me during this time of extreme anxiety and I will forever be grateful for his willingness to help.. Tyler sticks to a commitment. He committed to being a YL volunteer leader and on multiple occasions on a weekly basis he had to carve out time or put off other activities to fulfil this obligation. One significant example is the fact he sacrificed a family trip to see his brother's graduation in order to fulfil a commitment to be a camp leader at a YL summer camp.. Tyler pushes thru his fears to do a task even when he's uncomfortable. Recently, Tyler, his brother and I were kayaking in a bay. The water was deep and dark, you could not see the bottom. Tyler's brother and I started swimming. While we were swimming, Tyler informed us he has a fear of deep dark water where you can't seethe bottom. After some coaxing and encouragement, Tyler pushed past his fear and got in the water to swim with us.. Tyler will put others first, even if it costs him. One hot summer day, Tyler came home from playing soccer. He was overheated and exhausted. Despite the hot / difficult conditions Tyler's brother wanted to go for a bike ride, but he did not want to ride alone. Tyler agreed to ride with him, even though he was overheated and exhausted. Tyler put his brother's wishes first, and went for the ride so his brother did not have to ride alone. Midway thru the ride, Tyler had to push himself so hard that he passed out and crashed the bike.. In the hours leading up to my first show I was getting understandably nervous. Anxiety, and some light dry heaving was is expected I guess. Whenever these kinds of things happen, when I push myself out of my comfort zone by some ridiculous drive to live, there is always a little voice in the peanut gallery of my mind telling meI suck. This voice doesn't usually go away, until I do something well, or until the end of the show (hopefully not). So this voice shows up and it fucking with my juju on schedule and, of course, there's really nothing anybody can do about it. The three of you did well to talk me up and push in some last minute confidence. As we took stage that had helped a bit, and I don’t think I ever thanked you and Blake and Joe for that... Thanks. But now on stage, while not dry heaving anymore, I was still tormented by my own fucking anxiety voice. I’m standing super still and having my own little panic attack when I look over at you and Blake. Blake is doing his Type A routine (I talk shit but I did the same thing) but you.. you just looked happy to be there and more important you looked resolute. That chill, that demeanor.. It would make Ice Hawk proud. You looked happy to be up there and pumped to play. That calmed me down, not completely of course, but enough to get through the first 10seconds while the music drowned out the stupid fucking voice. In your own form of charismatic confidence, which is what I’m chalking it up as, you got me to do something kick ass. So if you could learn to channel that... That’d be good.. Freshman year was weird. I was gone the first half of the year. In January I got back and was immediately thrown into the fully incubated freshman bro-douche culture of Floor 10 Tower B. It was like Lord of the Flies down there. I tried to keep pace with those guys but that lifestyle kicked my ass. Halfway through the semester my grades were bad, I was exhausted. At on point half my damn torso was bruised from a bad game of drunken 5-star. Not good. So like any sane person, I ran. I went up a couple floors to you and Hony’s room and made it out of the semester alive. With the help ofx-box, the cribs and studying of course. The point of this buildup is that, as I started coming to you more and more, you folded me into your friend group with ease. Since I want to make this easier to process I will tell you this: that to me is empathy, and charisma. I’m going to include charisma again because I think it’s one of your more useful traits.. and it happens to apply well as a descriptor. But! Your understanding of my situation, and helping me out, was an important part of my avoidance of first semester desolation. You also did pretty much the same thing in 9th grade. I've made a habit of missing the first part of major life changes in my earlier years I guess. Choosing me to remember specific events, out of context, that illustrate your many qualities (which cannot be questioned) probably not your smartest move. You know my memory is crap. I’m more of a contextual memory kind of guy. So with that in mind, here is my last story: a collage of sorts. Basically sum up every time we have gotten to hang after a long ass time. All those hang out sessions in Ship or when I would get back to Pittsburgh for the summer. After all those restarts (of a sort) I know no one who is as good as you are at falling into that same rhythm. Now this may begetting a little abstract but bear with me. You have always been an easy person to talk to. To confide in. This, again, has to do with charisma (#common theme). Yet I'm still always surprised by how easy it is to fall in to step when we hang out after awhile apart. I’m not sure why it surprises me. On paper I know you’re charismatic. You're my best friend so it shouldn’t surprise me, but every time we see each other after a long absence I am always surprised. So there you go. I’ll call it joie de vivre. Hope that helps.. Tyler, one of your greatest strengths is your humility. During your internship with me, I had many opportunities to see you respond to assigned tasks without complaining and you did them with great joy. Beyond just completing tasks, your life exemplifies humility. There hasn’t been a time in the last 2-3 years that you haven’t been reading multiple books at a time. This shows your desire to learn and grow. In the internship context we were in together, you would always respond well to suggestions on how to lead better. You made me feel honored in that. Your humility really shines with your interactions with others. You constantly would make time to talk with others (Gary, Ryan, etc) even in the craziness of two-part time jobs, and getting ready for OTS. Your always learning, always growing, and always listening. The humility that is a part of your character will set you up to thrive in whatever role you find yourself in.. Tyler, you are at your best in one on one situations. Don’t get me wrong I think you can lead big groups of people. You showed that during your internship but you are very gifted in one on one situations. I haven’t encountered many people in my life that can listen to others like you do. You make other people feel truly heard. You do great at asking questions, seeking people’s perspective and can even challenge people without seeming threatening. Mitch, Gary, myself and many others can attest to this.. Tyler, another strength of yours is adaptability. During your internship you had many different types of responsibilities and we threw you into many different opportunities. You showed great adaptability in leading for our team night in the courtyard (30people), to leading in Baker Center (450 people). One specific example of this would be when you had to lead on Easter Sunday in the CMC. Different room, different people, different tech, in a space that only has that service once a year. You adapted well.. Thorough the time that I've known Tyler, one thing that continuously stands out is his dedication. When Tyler has an idea or a passion, he manages to commit himself to it completely and successfully. Most notably, his dedication to music and to his art has stood out to me. His music was always more than a hobby, and is truly important to his sense of self, and his ability to succeed. Tyler's band was the product of his determination to create beautiful and lasting connections. The group grew out of a shared passion between Tyler and his brother into a successful act that could stand on it's. Tyler remained dedicated and passionate about his music even after the band members moved on, writing dozens of songs and performing whenever he could. I have never known another person to remain so steadfastly dedicated to a craft without becoming negative or losing their motivation.. Tyler is one of the most steady minded person that I know. We completed an undergraduate degree in Architecture together, which proved how capable Tyler really is of keeping himself grounded. Long nights and numerous all-nighters have shaped a level of discipline that many may never find. I remember taking breaks in our work to go eat together and heading into the studio at sunset. After a night of work before a presentation, we would emerge with a few other studio-mates to seethe sunrise and continue on to present our work that same day.. Tyler keeps those important to him close. A sense of comradely has always been prevalent around Tyler. He is there when all friends need him most. I remember going through difficult time full of mixed emotions and feelings. Some friends might have just been there to plug a generic response, but Tyler was there to listen to me and help me through. Tyler is one of the most understanding friends I've ever had and will most definitely go out of the way to be there for his friends.. Tyler is at his best when he is immersed in his art. Tyler is, hands down, the most creative, artistically-gifted individual I've ever met. From writing songs and making music, to story-boarding music videos, to painting, to acting, Tyler communicates through his art in truly compelling, inspiring, and deeply moving ways. I can't even remember how many times I've heard the phrase, ""who is that kid singing this song??,"" after someone saw Tyler perform in church or listened to a recording he was singing on. They were so moved by his passion and talent. And throughout our friendship, I've noticed that Tyler is at his best, most comfortable self when he's leaning into this creativity.. Tyler is at his best when he is wrestling with the world around him. I've enjoyed many, many evenings just sitting and talking with Tyler—whether faith, philosophy, politics, or social issues. I've met few people who read, research, and think through things to construct their worldview more than Tyler. He is driven by knowledge and a deep desire to explore the world around him. He takes very little at face value—that is, he wrestles deeply with a given idea before deciding to adopt it or not into his world view. He is constantly seeking ways to grow, learn, and to challenge himself. Many times, this manifestation of ""wrestling with the world around him"" presents itself through his art. He writes songs exploring the tensions held in life. He processes his emotions and thoughts through music. And emotionally, mentally, spiritually, even relationally, Tyler seems to be at his best when he's in sync with this creative outlet. To pull from the imagery of exercising, his art is almost like spiritual/emotional ""sweat"" as he grapples with the world around him.. Tyler is at his best when he pours himself whole-heartedly into whatever he's doing. He is a truly passionate guy, and throws all of his energy into the things he believes in. There's little room for ""filler"" or ""fluff"" in his life—he operates and thrives on a deeper level than many I know. If something doesn't satisfy a deeply held passion or belief, Tyler will cast it aside in search of the thing that truly satisfies his deeper passions and convictions. And it's this aspect that I believe more or less encompasses the first two stories. It's because he's only satisfied when he's 100% invested in something that has driven him to create such compelling art. To be true to himself, he demands excellence—he's not satisfied with doing something 70% or 80% or even 90%. It's100% or nothing. True artists pour themselves unreservedly into their art, and it's because Tyler pours gives himself wholly that makes his art so incredibly compelling and meaningful. Likewise, it's this passion and desire to pour himself fully into something that leads him to wrestle with the world around him. He's not ok with blindly accepting something or simply going through the motions—he needs to pour himself fully into something to make sure it aligns with who he is and how he views the world. He needs to truly believe in it and feel it. And it's out of this ""all-in"" mentality that he finds his incredible drive, passion, eagerness to learn, and knowledge—all things he uses to inspire and lead those around him.",30

He's always thereto help another in need, no matter how big or small the situation is. Rudy always knows how to get solve a situation, and on one instance of an intense volleyball game, where we hit the ball over 50ft into the air and getting stuck in a tree. We thought all hope was lost, and as college students with a ton of debt, we couldn't really afford another volleyball. We didn't know what to do, so we decided to try to climb the tree. A very dangerous idea as someone could get hurt. Mitchel noticed that we had two pool swimmers, that were about 20ft long. He asked me if we had duct taped, and boom, a 40ft pole was made. With the height of Mitchel, the 40ftpole, and a small jump, success of made, and so was my day. We played Volley ball again.. Strength doesn't mean that you have to be physically strong or mentally strong. A strength that Mitchel values are his emotions and compassion to other people. He's always there to help a hand or have some to talk to. While finishing up my last semester in college, I got hit with a lot of horrible news that personally affected me as a person. I didn't feel the same, and I was too nervous to talk to someone about. I just kept these emotions in me and pretended to be happy. The first person to notice was Mitchel, he knew there was something wrong about, he knew I wasn't feeling right. He reached out to me, and helped me along the journey of feeling better and becoming my old self.. Mitchell Rudy is an upstanding young man. In June 2012, we both attended a graduation party for our friend Eric. I personally cannot swim but no one knew this at the time. An individual decided to push me into a pool, which put my life in danger. I began drowning, flailing and grasping for the surface to reach air. The other attendees thought I was pretending to be bad at swimming. After a few seconds which seemed like forever, it was Mitchell who took initiative and sprung into action in an effort to save me. He pulled me out of the water and then took his time to make sure I was okay. I chose this example to express how strong Mitchell is, not only physically but mentally and spiritually as well. This man saved my life, and I can't thank him enough.. A few years ago, there was a hurricane that caused a county-wide power outage that lasted about a week. Since it was the middle of the summer, it was uncomfortably hot and humid. Because of this, people were scrambling to buy power generators wherever they could find them and my family was not lucky enough to get one in time. Despite our phones dying and the inability to even use a fan to cool off, we were mostly concerned that our groceries were going to go bad soon. After exhausting all possible options, I used what battery was left in my phone to contact nearby friends to see if they could help in any way. Mitchell Rudy, who has lived down the street from me for as long as I can remember, was the only one to respond. We were only hoping to borrow some extra ice-packs or something to our food and milk cold, but he offered to let my family borrow a power-generator, as his family purchased two as a precaution. Before I could even respond, he was already at my door to save the day.. I was driving to my friend’s house one night for a small get-together, when I realized my car was incredibly low on gas. My car ended up running out and I had to pull over on the side of the highway. That had never happened to me before, so I had no idea what to do since the nearest gas station was still several miles away. I called a friend of mine who was at the get-together to ask for help. He gladly agreed to help, but he didn't have his car with him. He asked everyone in the room if anyone would be willing to help me. After almost every person in the room said “no” to helping me, the only one who said “yes” was Mitchell Rudy. Mitchell and my other friend brought me more than enough gas to get me to the gas station. I offered Mitchell compensation for what he did for me, but he declined all offers saying “that won’t be necessary.”. I was playing Volleyball with a bunch of friends when the ball got hit into a very tall tree. There must have been 6 people trying to help get the ball out of there. There were a few people trying to knock it out of the tree by throwing things at it, but nobody could hit it. Somebody else was trying to reach the ball with a pool skimmer while standing on a ladder, but it was just out of reach. It got to the point where my friend's father decided to chop the branch down, however the branch was too thick for him to cut down in a reasonable amount of time. Mitchell gave it a moment of thought and noticed there was another pool skimmer and had the brilliant idea to duct tape the pool skimmers together. From there, reaching the ball took almost no effort.. Mitchell has always been extremely authentic in what he says and thinks. He is genuine in his efforts and his outward self. What you see is what you get. He does not pretend to be something he is not, and is comfortable with who he is. This allows him to live and work at a high level of confidence in who he is and his abilities. It also allows others to depend on him because they know that they are always getting his true self.. Mitchell is very compassionate to others. Growing up and throughout school he has always treated people with respect and compassion. He has welcomed in to his group and inner circle others who may not initially have appeared to be like him, but he sees the true inner spirit of each person and judges off that. He has gone out of his way to play with and take care of the family dogs. He gives them all the affection, attention, and love they could ask for. His love and respect for these pets shows he values life in all creatures, and understands his place in the world.. Mitchell is an extremely dedicated hard worker. He is demanding of himself and others when he is responsible for a group project. During his many years in school, he has been involved in numerous group projects where he has ensured that he not only meets his expectation, but he goes above and beyond to ensure that each projects requirements are met in a highly successful conclusion. He realizes that his work performance is a reflection on him and does not want to let down the organization or his peers.. Mitchell’s determination and perseverance was seen for over a two-year period with his athleticism. Having being accepted into the Air Force scholarship program, Mitchell knew he would need to up his physical fitness so he enrolled in Endeavor Sports Performance. In the beginning, he had to learn all the new exercises along with the proper technique, having a trainer correcting just about every move he made for the first two to three months. Straighten your back, use your legs, don't jerk, keep your eye straight. As the regiment continued the need to provide constant correction drastically reduced; yet with each new 4-week workout, Mitchell had to push his body beyond his last work out; beyond his comfort zone. As a result, for his internal drive and determination he was able to enter the Air Force with the strength he needed to pass a physical fitness test without worry.. Compassion. Although reserved in showing his emotions, Mitchell shows compassion and kindness for his younger sister Rachel. While in college, his younger sister Rachel was at a social gathering one Saturday night. As the event progressed into the early hours of the night, the crowd was getting a little too rowdy for Rachel. Rachel, knowing her parents were asleep and wouldn’t hear the phone, she called her big brother at 1:00 am in the morning and asked for him to come to the college and pick her up. Without hesitation, Mitchell grabbed his car keys and drove 10 miles to pickup his sister and bring her home. Rachel reciprocated the favor when Mitchell locked his keys in the car while at the college and at 12:00 midnight his sister had to come with the spare key. Rachel drove 10 miles to the college to meet Mitchell and found out she brought the keys to dad’s work car, also a Ford Explore. They both had to return home for the correct keys and drive once again to the college to pick up the sitting truck. All the while laughing at the situation and stopping at the 24 hours convenience store for some grub.. Mitchell has always been a role model to me. Since I understood how smart Mitchell is I’ve wanted to follow in his footsteps. I have a different type of mindset than others and without him being so smart, I probably wouldn’t be at the level I am now. He had lead me down a well-rounded path, where I know how to study, time manage, and say it’s okay to get a bad grade. From middle school where I took up playing the clarinet because he did, trying out every AP class that he took, and wanting to be an engineer. I may not have had the skill set to take the AP courses in high school but boy did I take them so he saw that I had the potential to be like him. To get that recognition that I was able to do something smart like him. I picked engineer because that's what I saw he did, later on did I realize I like accounting and switched majors entering into my freshman year of college. Mitchell has the quality of a leader in the sense that once people see what he can do, they will want to strive to be like him. I know I did.",12

She'll move into a new job and quickly survey the situation. I believe this is due to her strong intuition and instincts. She's good at reading people and promptly figures out the most efficient way to get things done. She's been this way from a very young age. While getting her education in economics she was given the opportunity to work for the Corps of Engineers in the Contracting Division as an intern. She devised a better way to file contracts and developed a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the division. She did great in an advertising agency and adjusted nicely. She did well as a waitress and a bartender. Oh and let's not forget her pizza making abilities. In each different industry she learned how to work smarter not harder. She's great with people and see's the good in everyone. The Rock Wall. When Laura was in the 9th grade, I believe. We just arrived back in Alaska around 2004. We used to take her and her brother John to the rock wall inside the old BX at Elmendorf. Of course John was like a monkey but Laura never did like heights. She struggled with the wall. However what impressed me about Laura washer ability to never give up. After several trips she triumphed and finally made it to the TOP! Yes it scared her but she never gave up and succeeded. Which leads me into the next story.. I must tell the story of a hike I did with Laura. It was in the Talkeetna Mountains of Alaska. The Reed Lakes Trail out of Hatcher's Pass near Palmer Alaska. It's a tough trail with lots of rocks, and scree to get through with over 4000 feet of elevation gain in 6 miles. This particular hike we extended our trek up the mountain to catch a glimpse of the Bomber Glacier where an old Air Force B-29 four-engine bomber, based out of Elmendorf Air Force Base had crashed in 1957 killing six crew members. I'd made several scouting trips trying to find this bomber. This trip Laura accompanied me and we set out to find the bomber. Most of the day we had beautiful weather as we climbed and kept climbing all day up the trail past old gold mines, beaver ponds, creeks, water falls, and the beautiful Reed lakes. Laura was a trooper and hung in there as we climbed. But the real test came as we were ascending the final 2000 feet up the boulders and scree to get to the top of the mountain where there is a notch to stand and see down the opposite side of the mountain to the glacier with the bomber still laying there after all these years like a ghost. The clouds started moving in as we were half way up the side of the mountain within a bowel. Then it started to rain, we kept climbing. I couldn't believe it at first but we started hearing thunder as we neared the top. The rocks and boulders were getting wet and slippery as we got close to the top. The thunder moved in and we knew lightning was all around us but couldn't see it. Very surreal as it was raining and we were basically shrouded in fog and clouds on the side of a mountain knowing there were steep drop-offs. I was definitely nervous but Laura was frightened beyond measure. What really impressed me was how Laura overcame her fear and her fear of heights as we made our way to the top. She persevered. It was cold and still raining when we made it to the top. I have a photo of this moment which I cherish. As we stood there I was finally, for the first time, rewarded with spotting the bomber way down below on the glacier. The clouds opened up for a spell. I had finally found the way to the old bomber on the glacier after four tries and Laura was there to share in the moment. We were cold and wet and running out of time so we eventually made our way back down the boulder field which is always harder than going up. Sliding and scrambling we kept descending and moving, we were cold and wet and this was the best way to keep halfway warm. With fog all around us and misting we hoofed it for the next several hours and finally made it back to the truck. That was a hike to remember and I must say Laura was a real trooper that day!. We traveled the country after I retired from the Air Force in a 5th wheel trailer. Laura was in the 6th grade when we started our travels from Alaska. We home schooled Laura and her younger brother John as we traveled the country and their geography lesson was the new sites we came across, along with all the other school curriculum they studied daily. Laura was always very good from the beginning at getting her school work done. I believe our travels is what helped Laura to be very adaptable to new environments and look for new opportunities. One idea Laura came up with was to make lizards out of beads for earrings and necklaces and sell them. We stopped and stayed at military FamCamps (campgrounds) mainly. Families were always coming and going. Very transient. Basically new clientele on a daily basis. Laura took this opportunity to start her very own first business. She worked hard at making beadjewellery and set about selling them. With her profits she bought more supplies and made more inventory. I mean who could resist her salesmanship and charm! She was a young entrepreneur! I know, right!?!. Laura was born in Alaska, and home schooled starting in the 2nd grade; her Dad retired from the Air Force so looking for adventure, as a family, we traveled and lived in a fifth-wheel touring the lower 48 States for 2 years until 9-11. Settling in Cheyenne, WY, Mom went back to work so Laura, and her little brother John, started public school a few months later. Laura would be in 7th grade, and well ahead of her peers academically as she was enrolled in an 8th grade mechanical drawing class. Laura's teacher called us in, and showed us freehand renditions of mechanical drawings she had made expressing he'd, ""never seen anything like this as most drawings of this type were typically done on computers."" Laura's Grandpa, Mom, Dad, and big sister are all Air Force Veterans; her little brother is active duty Air Force, so it was logical Laura would follow these steps and join the Air Force where she became a Dental Lab Technician. Laura is an artist, from a family of artists; she can whittle out an old man's face on a piece of wood, and whittle such a perfect tooth, or a whole set of teeth, for someone who has one or who has none - giving each and every tooth she creates, her personal best, for those in need. Laura's artistic creativity, and attention to detail, using hand-eye coordination, and her ability to work independently, have brought credit upon her and her Area Dental Lab as clinics from around the nation have called upon her to create complex and unique teeth, crowns, and bridges using a variety of materials; as every job is as unique as every patients teeth are different. In a constantly changing field of new developments, new methods, and new technological innovations, Laura's knowledge of these trends remained on the cutting edge which has impacted many lives and itis with confidence as Laura grows in her Air Force career as an Officer, she will learn and lead with the same creativity and attention to detail which, will bring credit and honor upon the United States Air Force.. After living in Wyoming for 3 years, we moved back to Alaska where Mom took a job with the US Army Corps of Engineers. At the age of 15, Laura was given special privileges to enrol in college by the Dean at the University of Alaska Anchorage. After acing one class, the Dean gave her a free pass for which she was now earning dual credit toward high school and college. Laura graduated high school a year ahead of her peers, finished her Freshman year of college, worked at a local Pizza place, and she was dating a young man name Isaac, whom she met when she was 15 years old. Isaac, a young man she adored, wasn't doing well in high school and was going to drop out as he was not able to get his priorities in order and was struggling. Laura was hired by Isaac's parents to tutor Isaac; she helped him to understand those subjects he was struggling with, and helped him in meeting his assigned academic; deadlines. Soon Isaac's grades, and his confidence, began to improve; Isaac graduate high school and Laura encouraged him to go to college where he is majoring in Philosophy and Art. Laura married Isaac, joined the Air Force, and has excelled in her field as a Dental Lab Technician. Laura continues to encourage her husband, Isaac, in living his dream, which has blossomed into beautiful pieces of ceramic art much like their love for each other.. It was kind of amazing Laura was assigned to the same dormitory her Mom was assigned to at Lackland's Air Force Basic Training, and that her little brother, John, would be assigned to the same dormitory as his Dad, was all those many years ago too. When Laura went to basic who knew she'd be chosen to be in the Drum & Bugle Corps, and who knew the TI would not allow the girls to pluck their eye brows! That proud photo moment came, while dressed in your best blues, is now forever immortalized by those infamous bushy brows; that was so wrong. Laura is petite, standing at 5'2"" and when the band marched she was carrying this heavy drum, which was almost a third of her height, and for the most part, the drum did it's best to keep her off balance and out of step! At her BMTS graduation the band proudly played, and marched, as Laura gracefully swayed and balanced the drum, doing her best to stay synchronized with the rest of the flight; in filming this graduation, and in viewing it, we are still laughing, through loving eyes, as we watch her march with this beast of a drum, as the drum sling slapped the back of her legs, while she struggled to stay in step she thoughtfully succeeded in being out of cadence which was a lesser evil than tripping. We were so proud of our baby girl, for her to have been chosen to be in the Drum and Bugle Corps which was such a huge honor for us too!. The first time I met Laura I knew she had a unique character. She was very friendly and open and always made time to talk about what was going on at work. I always admired her passion to go after what she wanted. It's easy to say you want to commission but only a very rare few stick with it. Her attitude was consistently good and was a positive role model for other Airmen. With all of the guests that come to visit the ADL, I always knew who would impress them....SrA Takakuwa. She is a versatile person who has and will excel at whatever she sets her mind to and it was tough knowing she was leaving the team, but great knowing that she was going to have a bigger impact across the Air Force.. I was fortunate to be around when Laura was notified of making SSgt. I believe she was the only member in the unit to make it without a Must Promote or a Promote Now statement on her EPR. She was nervous when it was testing time because she was supposed to find out about her selection to OTS prior to her test but the release of the officer program was delayed so her promotion test was going to be before she found out if she was going to become an officer. She managed her time, somehow, to put in the work to study knowing that she may never wear the rank. This is the caliber of person she is. She may not have pinned on before her brother but she did get to pin on and officially become SSgt Laura Takakuwa.. One of the things I remember most about Laura is her relationship with her dad. I never had the chance to meet him but I know she is his heart. She has accomplished more than most Airmen at this stage of their careers and there has to be a driving force behind that. I know her dad is proud of her and rightfully so. I know he is a big part of her life and as a father of 2 girls, I hope that my daughters have as much love for me when they are grown as she does for him.. Laura Takakuwa provided exceptional guidance and compassion during my troubled time recently in the Air Force. I was going through a difficult transition between supervisors and obtained a new Staff Sergeant and new supervisor as my own. We were both blindsided, as I was a “go getter” and “shining star” airman, and she was brand new to the workplace and immediately got a troop. She continuously went the extra mile to prove her authority and attempted multiple times, only succeeding once to write paperwork. I came to Laura to confide in her first as a friend, then as a fellow airman. She provided words of wisdom that helped me understand the importance of not giving up when everything is going wrong. I trusted Laura, and took her advice. Giving up only showed my surroundings that whoever was bringing me down won, and that I gave into letting myself as a person go. Laura continued to give me compassionate advice, as well as blunt advice, knowing both would help me understand. She has continued to be there for me any time I needed guidance. I have appreciated every incident I could share with her while seeking guidance.. I was a new airman stationed at Peterson Air Force base, and someone at my dental clinic recommended I contact SrA Laura Takakuwa if I want to get on a good path in the Air Force. For someone to instantly think of her and recommend me to contact her proves she has amazing potential to accomplish anything she puts her mind to. She was one of the first airmen I reached out to and obtained valuable information to get on the right path towards getting Airman Below the Zone. Considering she got Airman Below the Zone and made Staff Sergeant her first time was great inspiration for myself to keep pushing. She has always been an inspiration of mine because of all of her accomplishments! Her reputation amongst senior leadership has continued to grow and become one of the best I continue to hear due to her help, guidance, and motivation.. I have also wanted to enlist in the Air Force then commission through a program. She has been my go to person to obtain every ounce of information I can to accomplish this goal. Her leadership skills, motivation, dedication, and aspiration has led her to where she is now, and I continue to look up to her. Because of her leadership skills, compassion, whole airmen concept, and guidance, she has been accepted into OTS and continues to strive in one of her best atmospheres, a learning environment. She never stopped trying to learn as much as she could. Every time she reached out tome, she recommended I read an article that she had because it provided incredible, valuable information that pertained to bettering your life.. . You have this super power strength of listening and reflecting. From writing letters and chatting over the phone in our teenage years to being eye to eye with each other on visits. I feel heard by you when I'm struggling in my life or I'm excited about something. Not only do you listen, and take in what I'm saying - you reflect back tome in offerings of what you think and feel. This is true in so many areas of our lives -when we talk about politics, relationships, work, passions. Tony Robbins is big on the female energy needing three things - to feel safe, seen, and understood. I feel that with you and it's powerfully bonding. We can be driving through Rocky Mountain National Park, on a road trip to Glenwood Springs, or dancing around the living room. You listen to me, not just verbally, but you also pay attention to what's unsaid. You're highly observant. You've always been there for me. I'm not always easy, yet you still listen to me and give love. You're very giving and I am so grateful to know you. You bask in the opportunity to be a loving human - which is not an easy task. I know you're expanding a conversation when you pause the show/podcast/music to talk about an idea. I love hearing your thoughts and insights. You've listened to me cry countless times and you listen to others, even when they drive you mad. You truly listen to them. It's easy to let other distractions in but you don't. You tune in and stay with someone in conversation. Listening. I love that about you so much. From when I fist came to the trailer your family had in Cheyenne I knew you were kind hearted. We ate salads and you introduced me to your rats. Another strength you hold is kindness and caring for all life. Animal and human life. From Gunner and Cesar to Ty Ty, plus all strangers' dogs and even cats and horses that make you deathly allergic. I see that kindness when you meet new people. I know that when we go to Kathy's or to a friends with animals that you'll be sure to introduce yourself to them and the critters - giving all attention and love. I adore this about you. Because it shines how incredible your character truly is. It shows how respectable you are and that you have this gigantic heart. I gasp every time I see roadkill now because you made me feel and realize just how sad it is. I remember feeling that from you on my fist visit to Alaska when we drove around and you were propped up by a cushion in your car! You have visited me countless times even though it drives your allergies bonkers with the kitties. You love Titus like he is your child, and he is. You stay dedicated to your word and goals, you listen to others whether it be family, someone new, or a puppy you just met. You are one of the most kind, loving, hardworking individuals that I know. These are just a few of your strengths. I know that you tap into new areas each day. I am so proud to be your friend. I love you!. Cohesion When reflecting upon it, during the duration of our friendship, the most distinguished moments of leadership were displayed during our initial time of in-processing at Peterson Afb. Although there were collective moments of making phone calls, scheduling appointments, and achieving training that we did together-it was probably the best examples of working with cohesion to achieve a common goal. Maybe your experience was different than mine, but this particular moment in our in-processing stood out. When we had to go to our First Term Airman’s Course (FTAC),it’s my recollection that we were both trying to achieve the sharp airmen award. We both looked sharp in our service dress, we both were engaged in the classroom, we both volunteered to represent our group’s essay, and we both had to vote for each other to achieve the award. Despite how confident I was that you were going to get the award, I ended up getting the Sharp Airmen award. You could have been biter, you could have been more competitive, but instead you set the precedence of our friendship; to celebrate in one another's success. Due to be so taken back and surprised that I had been awarded sharp airmen award, you nudged my side to remind me that I was to lead our class in the Airman’s creed. This is quintessential because sometimes others will succeed you, and it’s best to continue to help them through their journey rather than let our self-righteousness (we’re all prone to it) get the best of us. In order to lead, we must know how to follow. In addition, afterwards we reconvened at the end of the ceremony; you reassured me that I had rightfully earned the award. I was not all entirely convinced. Not only were we becoming friends, but I felt you conducted yourself in a manner that had earned as well. Now as Airman on our way becoming leaders, more importantly as the new generation of women in the military, it is imperative that we work together to build each other up. As you move forward throughout your career, remember that moment, our job is to not only ensure we succeed but others as well.. Conflict and Resolution Conflict isn’t always a direct dispute between two people. Most conflict happens within us. Everyone is fighting their own internal battles. This isn’t exactly a story of conflict between us. I don’t know if you and I ever had direct conflict with each other. I have always prided our friendship for its simplicity and auto-maintaining qualities. During Buheur’s difficult time separating the military, he’s incestuous emotional well-being impeded on our personnel lives. It got in the way of the ones we loved and our own emotional needs. It was clear Buhuer needed professional help that we couldn't give him. So working together (do you see the common theme of cohesion?)Chiaravalle would talk to him, then you, and eventually me. Buehuer often times discussed about taking his own life casually-almost too cavalier. Obviously a sane person would be genuinely worried and value another person’s life. We valued Buhuer’s life more than he did. It was tolling on our own welfare. The conflict came about that he if were going to be serious enough to suggest taking his own life, we had to make the choice to take it seriously. It was then, each one of us found it profoundly difficult to call the local authorities or the suicide hotline. Despite that, Buhuer had made hurtful statements and implications towards you; you reached out to the veteran’s suicide hotline to contact him. What made it difficult was that we weren't sure how serious he was about committing suicide, but he talked about it. Therefore, we had to take it seriously. As much as we don’t want to admit it, we were worried we would be wasting the crisis hotline or the police’s time. It seems shameful, but we honestly were conflicted with Buhuer killing himself seriously. It seems silly looking back at it, but for one reason or another-each one of us was worried at how he might react to us. The simple fact was Buhuer was unstable. We were worried he was going to hurt himself or even us. This was our internal conflict. You found the resolution to help him in a way that wasn’t easy. I am not too sure how often leaders are confronted with this conflict, but I would imagine it happens pretty frequently. That is: helping our own in ways they may or may not agree with.. Knowledge and wisdom The more obvious attributes to being a leader is passing on knowledge and wisdom. This can get tricky because it plays on our pride and it’s easy to lack the humility to get new, but imperative, perspective. A basic means to overcoming this is show someone your knowledge, but look for an exchange where they can show you something new. Not only is it a process of gaining knowledge for both parties, but itis a constructive means to strengthen relationships-it’s all part of the human experience. It also forces you to play on the strengths of your subordinates-looking for something they can teach you. Thankfully, I never really thought you were one of the ones that struggled with this concept. When you helped me with the software for all-ceram, I in turn, refreshed your memory on sprinkling hard night guards. This concept of seeking help, putting aside your pride, has always been something that comes naturally to you. Building off of one another’s experiences is what we do. If I helped you with running for a pt test, later you would be subjected to my arduous push up work out that helped me with my pt test. Despite not needing help with push-ups or maxing out on pushups-your presence meant a lot; sometimes demonstrating interest in someone else’s knowledge is learning it with them. These are all collective incidents. The truth is, I know you did this with many others throughout the ADL, so it seems to come naturally to you. We were always the ones who showed people how to put their hazmat suits on for our disaster training. In that, you were able to demonstrate how to set up the I.P.P.D tent for the entire group. There isn’t a singular story that resonates with me, because it wasn't something you struggled with - let people in, if they can show you another means to achieving a job, let them.. One of Laura’s qualities that I admire and am very grateful for is her ability to forgive me. We started dating when we were young and have been together for more then10 years now. She had always been mature about our relationship and worked hard to make it work. I on the other hand was immature and stumbled through a lot of the younger part of the relationship. I am so grateful that she forgave me for being dumb and gave me second chances when I screwed up. Looking back, there was so many times that she held our relationship together all on her own. I have grown to love and cherish our friendship and relationship. I am so grateful that she never gave up on it and on me.. Laura is not afraid to stand up to authority when required. There had been a miscommunication about a meeting between a supervisor and her about a meeting time. The supervisor wrote up a lOC. It had said she was unreliable. She wrote a email backlisting all of her accomplishments in the military, how she had made below the zone, the fact that she was put in charge of shipping and receiving for the largest dental lab even though she was just an airman, the fact that she had just been accepted to OTS and the list went on. The supervisor called her in and apologized to her and never submitted the LOC. It was impressive to me to stand up to authority especially in the military.. Laura has had the goal to be an officer in the air force since before I knew her. She graduated with a degree in economics early and could have gone strait for officer from the get go. She decided to enlist first and I didn’t understand why until she explained her reasoning. She wanted to be a good leader. She wanted to see both sides of the military. The enlisted side, and the officer side. She wanted to make a life career in the military and saw the value in understanding and relating to those you are reasonable for. It was a decision that I admire. It shows a commitment to not just being a leader but being a good leader.. Commitment, Tenacity and Grit. On a wintry Alaskan evening with snow piling-up thickly on the ground, Laura continued to dig through the drifts. Her father-in-law had given-up the co-search an hour or so before as the temperature continued to drop and the icy wind barreled down. He had held the flashlight for her as long as he could, but his resolve had frittered-away. Laura’s resolve, however, remained intact. Earlier that afternoon she had found out that her husband’s watch, an expensive gift she had given him, was missing. Immediately, Laura began what amounted to a crime scene search of the house and its occupants---couch cushions examined; furniture up-ended; pants pockets searched; witnesses interrogated. After having gone through the innards of the house and turned-up nothing, she determined that the watch might have fallen off her husband’s wrist into the driveway. Thus began the nighttime arctic search and rescue mission outside. Others would have written-off the watch or at least waited until daylight, but not Laura. She raked and dug through the snow, section-by-section, even as the snow accumulated and covered her tracks. Her sheer tenacity and grit amazed her in-laws, all of whom would occasionally peer-out at her from the window above. Hours later, face reddened from the cold and hair heavily matted with snow, Laura emerged from the night. She had not found the watch, but she had demonstrated a dedication to mission that literally was awe-inspiring to her husband’s family. Over the years, Laura has shown this kind of rare commitment to all aspects of her life---to her academic pursuits, to her family, and to her country.. Loyalty. Laura's husband’s little sister Jenna had an ongoing fascination with law enforcement. Not in being a peace officer, but rather an object of their pursuit. Laura's sister-in-law, several years her junior, enjoyed partying and, consequently, had had run-ins with the police on several occasions during high school. In several of these instances, Laura had come to Jenna’s aid, picking her up, acting as an intermediary, and even arranging for legal representation. Jenna knew that she could count on Laura’s family loyalty even with she didn’t really deserve it. Her in-laws, although aware that Laura had helped on a number of occasions, were ignorant of the extent to which Laura had stepped in to shield their daughter until just recently when Jenna shared these accounts with them. Jenna told her parents that Laura’s involvement in those incidents changed her life. It was Laura’s voiced disappointment in Jenna after the last police incident that made Jenna reevaluate her own behavior and make lasting changes for the better. Loyalty is second-nature to Laura.. Dedication and Long-Term Planning. Laura has a dedication to achieving her ends that is admirable. While some may achieve their goals with simple tenacity, Laura also employs a honed skill in long-term planning. She has demonstrated this penchant for planning time-and-time again in her academic and professional pursuits by making decisions based on the long-game. She applies this skill in her personal life, as well. At some point Laura decided Isaac was to be her life partner. Isaac, on the other hand, had not come to this realization as of yet. So it was necessary to persuade him that this was, indeed, to be his fate. Laura knew this might be a long-term project, but committed to it anyway. Laura took the opportunity to live with Isaac while he still resided in his parent's home. While this may have been a practical convenience for both of them, it was clear that Laura’s deeper intent was to practice a long-term relationship with Isaac and get him incrementally wed to the idea, himself. At times, it was a bumpy ride, but Laura’s diligence and adherence to her plan paid off---Laura and Isaac were married on August 14, 2011.. Laura, You are at your very best when honoring your commitments. I remember when your an those two long distance races, back-to-back with your father in Florida. I admired you so much, first because you agreed to participate in them to begin with, and second, because you went ahead with the second race after you ran the first one. I know you must have been so tired and aching after that first race. You could have easily decided not to run in the second one and no one would have blamed you, but you went ahead and did it. That took great inner strength and guts. I know you did it because you had committed to doing it and you did not want to let your Dad down. You unselfishly put your Dad’s needs first, over your own. Laura, Your strengths shine through when you are taking care of others. I know there were many times when you took care of Jenna and helped rescue her from some situations she had gotten herself into. I seem to recall Jenna telling me that you picked her up from a party when she had had too much to drink. She called her brother but you came instead. You didn’t hesitate to go out in the middle of the night to pluck her out of a bad situation. I am sure there are other things I don’t know about but I know you won't hesitate when people need you. You are dependable, reliable and do what needs to be done when others need you. These qualities make you not only a wonderful daughter, but also an excellent leader.. Laura, When Jenna told me she had chosen you as her Maid of Honor, I was so happy. I knew that she had chosen the most dependable and reliable person to help her through what can be a very happy but stressful event. You were always there for Jenna (and me). You helped us quietly behind the scenes with your lovely smile, poise, and grace. But you were not just a pretty face, your excellent organizational skills and project management skills helped us tremendously and I know you will put them to good use in the Air Force. We are so proud of you, Laura, not just for your steely strength, reliability, and excellent organizational skills, but also for your warmth, kindness, and loving spirit.",27

CENTCOM supervision felt the repair was going to be excessively difficult and costly to do at AL Udeid. Request was made to swap out. 168th leadership reached out to MSgt Skaggs. He had already been talking to other fuels personnel at Al Udeid. They had indicated that on numerous occasions they had requested to start diagnosing/repairing the A/C. Were ordered not to. MSgt Skaggs assured 168leadership that he knew what the problem was, and was confident he could repair it. Since MSgt Skaggs was schedule to deploy in a week to Al Udeid,168 leadership informed NGB/CENTCOM that personnel were inbound with repair capabilities and a swap out was unnecessary. MSgt Skaggs arrived at Al Udeid and was initially prohibited from starting to work on A/C. Once given permission, the aircraft was repaired in 3 work days. This narrative is a testament to the confidence MSgt Skaggs had in his team and himself, and the confidence the 168 Wing had in MSgt Skaggs.. The 168th Fuels flight suffered because of a number of marginal members. Through MSgt Skaggs efforts the effects of these shortfalls were not as impacting on the organization as they could have been. MSgt Skaggs spent countless hours both on, and off, duty assisting an Airman with huge relationship issues. This individual had married a lady with multiple children from another marriage. It became apparent to leadership that this was a toxic relationship. In the end it got so bad that the member was forced off base due to complaints. The Airmans spouse was verbally and physically abusive. MSgt Skaggs utilized his counselings experience to help this airman deal with the impending breakup. MSgt Skaggs was also able to help the individual identify that he had a drinking problem and through these effort the member was able to find an alcohol treatment program. Although these efforts did not always result in positive outcomes, MSgt Skaggs was a supportive influence for this Airman. He also had an individual who had no desire to adhere to military standards. MSgt Skaggs kept reinforcing the responsibilities and requirements needed to continue to be a Military member. They would challenge this individual and assist with his attempts to lose weight. Although these efforts did not always have the wished for results, MSgt Skaggs consistently encourage the individual to improve, at the same time hold him accountable. You could tell these were difficult issues for MSgt Skaggs because of his respect for the uniform and everything to goes along with it.. Transitioning from Enlisted to the Officer ranks can be a difficult decision. For someone with a family even more so. MSgt Skaggs was extremely thorough in his efforts to make this transition. First, he looked at it from a family perspective. How could he make this work and yet take care of his family. He was able to balance giving up an AGR salary through years of preparation for this time. He also has a number of options upon returning from AFOT/OTS. In talking with his family you can tell he has spent substantial time discussing this with his wife and kids. They are all supportive of this opportunity. He has a large group of support for his family, from his church, to members of the unit. Everyone around him is willing to help support him because we all know what an outstanding Officer he will be. Finally, he has a heart of an Officer. He cares about the Air Force, the USA, the State of AK, and his fellow airman. He is a compassionate individual yet has very high standards. These standards are for himself as well as others. As an NCOIC he already has a high degree of understanding for managing people and processes. MSgt Skaggs will be a great officer.. While working with him at 168TH FUEL CELL. He always has a positive outlook on everything we did. No matter how bad the day or job may seem he is resilient. His selflessness was seen when on 4 July when all others are off he volunteered to come in and help fix a broke jet. He did it with a great attitude and did it well.. He is always willing to go above and beyond what is needed. At work or off he gives110%. If asked to help out at church he is always willing to do what it takes even play and sing songs. One day at the last minute the leader was sick and we had no one to lead music Sunday morning. Without hesitation Jeff jumped in and took car of it. Great leader.. His like to living things up. He is a great listener and councilor. He gets others involved not just at work but also beyond work. For example whether it’s the yearly Christmas party or annual family day. He jumps in and plays the games like ugly sweater or getting his people to build a boat. He is fun to be around and makes you want to do more. He is a good/positive influence with the people he is around.. Jeff stood out to me as a humble servant leader from our first meeting at the KC-135Product Improvement Working Group (PIWG) in April of 2016. I had not yet assumed my new role as the 168th Maintenance Group Commander, and I had the chance to spend several days with Jeff and other members of the Group who attended. He talked about his education, and interest in behavioral health programs and counselling. He was working on a Bachelor’s degree at that point, and was seeking an internship in the field. He faced the challenge that most of the internships in the field were at the graduate level. He had a positive attitude about and a true desire to help other people. It was very clear to me that Jeff had goals for the future beyond his work in the KC-135 Maintenance Group, and that he put 100% focus into the work at hand as he pursued those goals. At the PIWG, he focused on the fuel system challenges that the KC-135 community faced. He clearly understood the system very well, and displayed confidence in that understanding as he communicated those challenges to the diverse group of military and civilians. His style is humble, unassuming, and he lets his work speak for itself. From that first meeting, it was clear to me that Jeff is respected by his peers.. One of the Aircraft deployed to the desert last year was down for an extended period due to a fuel leak. The deployed commander wanted to send the jet home to swap it out rather than fix it in place. He was convinced that they lacked a critical kit to properly troubleshoot and repair the leak. Jeff was in charge of the 168th Fuel shop at the time, and was scheduled to deploy in August. He spoke with one of our deployed members and believed the leak was repairable. He also determined that the kit was an item we possessed locally and hand carried it to the desert. From my seat back in Alaska, I saw that the Jet was fixed within three days of his arrival, and that Jeff was elevated to Chief of the Fuels section for the remainder of his deployment. That was quite a leap in leadership responsibility in a difficult deployed environment, and Jeff took it in stride with a very positive attitude. He also trained the others in the shop to troubleshoot and repair the same leak which they did at least three more times. He effectively learned to interact with the different cultures within the Air Force, and applied his skillset to developing Airmen. Given the opportunity, Jeff pushes the credit for this success to others rather than take it himself.. Eielson AFB gets cold in the winter, and very hot at times during the summer. It was on one of those very hot days that I witnessed Jeff’s dedication. We were near the end of shift when Jeff and another member of the Fuel shop passed me in the fenced section of 1176. The heat was evident in their beads of sweat and the fuel vapors coming off of their uniforms. They had been working a fuel issue on one of the aircraft on the ramp, and were on their way to another. Jeff didn’t leave any minutes on the work day clock as he focused on fixing our aircraft. Had I not passed them, I don't believe that Jeff would have said a word to me about his efforts or the conditions. That passing gave me insight into his service-before-self attitude.. In the summer of 2016 Jeff Skaggs and I deployed to Al U Deid Air base together. During the deployment Jeff showed he would do what was right even when all the cards were stacked against him. 24 hours after arriving I got a call from Jeff informing me that he was not going to show up for his shift. I established a meeting with Jeff and he informed me of all the problems he was having with his work center. I listened to him describe a work center of distrust and micromanagement. Jeff could have done what many do and put his head in the sand and endure this culture for 60 days; but instead he choice to highlight it to leadership and refuse to be part of it. During this deployment Jeff continued to make the best of a bad situation always doing the right thing even when it put his career at risk.. On assignment in Guam 2017 he demonstrated a strong ability to balance off duty morale while ensuring mission accomplishment. Jeff went out of his way to setup BBQ's and trips and helped foster an atmosphere of comradery. Many times as leader we lose sight of how important it is to establish off duty relationships. Jeff is an expert at bringing people together, making everyone feel welcome and important. His ability to connect with members on this personal level will continue to make Jeff one of the top leaders in the organization..

While golfing with Jeff I was poking some fun at him for his play the previous day. Where I said “yesterday you were hitting like 8 on this hole” Of course that was an exaggeration on my part because what good is poking fun with truths. Jeff took what I said as pure fabrication and I think I actually hurt his feelings or at a minimum insulted his golf game. So for the rest of the game I was sure to not insult or even exchange much dialog with Jeff. We were still cordial but engaged in banter we did not. Later that evening Jeff and I had a discussion on what happened earlier during golf. He explained I had a tendency to exaggerate happenings and he felt in the position that I hold (QA Superintended) I was held at a different level and I should know I am looked upon with more scrutiny than others. I thanked Jeff for his candor and willingness to inform me of my fault and to turn the event into a teaching moment even though he is the junior NCO.",13

I’m not going to be limited to just 3, instead, I’m going to highlight her entire well-being and what about her inspires me to be a better Senior NCO and a better person. First, let’s ask ourselves what a leader means and the skills necessary to be one and what others consider a leader. The definition is going to vary from person-to-person as there are thousands of articles and books published on the topic. To me, leadership is motivating others and influencing them to accomplish a set of goals (mission) for the greater good of . LG possesses quite a few of desirable traits naturally which I’m about to elaborate on. I’ve known LG for10+ years as we have been stationed together in 2 Air National Guard Units. Meeting her as a fellow junior enlisted Senior Airman, I’ve been blessed to watch her grow, expand her skills, and impart her work ethic unto others. I couldn’t be more proud to see her transition to the officer corps. If I had to rank her strengths in order, the one she excels at the most is her ethics and integrity. LG has strong moral values and ensures that when she is faced with a decision her actions are positive and not damaging. This is the core of who she is and the source of her influence. She lives the values she professes and this gives her the credibility and allows folks, myself included, to place trust. She always sets the example putting other people’s needs before her own and is transparent. She is one of the first to arrive on a drill weekend and almost always the last to leave. She takes responsibility not only for herself, but for the team, especially in non-optimal situations. When other Airman are not performing up to standards or behavior needs to be corrected, she first seeks to understand the root cause and address it, never with anger, providing feedback in a kind and respectful way. Next is her communication. There are many facets to communication and she exceeds at a majority of them. First, she listens to people...effectively. Not many recall that listening is vital to successful communication, but she does. She’s not condescending when she listens, in fact, she engages never rushing to judgment, is patient and genuine especially when understanding the thoughts and feelings of others. She is reasonable and asks questions. She is forthright when talking with individuals taking time to communicate showing how much she values the member and how important they are to the mission, unit, Air Force, and most importantly, as a person. She understands that different people respond to different mediums of communication, so when she has a message to pass on, she ensures it is transmitted verbally (via phone and/or in person) and via email. She then will take the time to follow up that folks received and understood the message. Last, LG has vision and the short-term/long-term goals/milestones needed to get there and be successful. Her ability to adapt and be agile is another attribute I admire. When new operational positions need to be evaluated, she is called upon to understand and assess what the position will contribute, what assets (people especially) will be impacted, and seeks out subject matter experts to find creative solutions to conundrums, making it the most efficient solution possible. Again, I am blessed to call her a leader, mentor, and my friend.. One of LG’s strengths is her positive, considered approach to problems. When dealing with challenges and discussing paths forward, LG assumes a friendly and respectful tack but, most importantly, identifies foreseeable problems and, when discussing these with leadership, readily points out her concerns with a superior's potential actions. This is useful for unit cohesion and success, but, more importantly here, illustrates LG’s capacity for understanding people and thinking through problems logically.. LG is direct and not afraid of confrontation. This is not to say that she welcomes or encourages it; rather, when working with leadership, coworkers, and subordinates, she has an open yet firm attitude that enables honest discussions and, as seen in the past, has encouraged others to crawl out of their shell more than they would have in a more aggressive situation.. Among other strengths, LG is reliable. Over her career with her guard unit, she has worn several different hats and worked a wide variety of jobs, and, in each case, quickly becomes a touchstone for the mission she supports. In loose parlance, “Put LG on that” equates to crossing “that” off the to-do list.. My wife Gwendolyn, or rather Nikki as is her preference, is a strong family matriarch. My propensity for risk aversion is counterbalanced by Nikki’s instinctive ability to act after reasonable risk analysis. If it were not for Nikki’s leadership, my family would be stuck in an invariant lifestyle as I am wont to do. It was Nikki’s vision that brought us to our beautiful home in Virginia, nestled in a town that exhibits a perfect pairing of the rural rolling foothills of the Shenandoah mountains and the culturally-rich and sophisticated urban Washington, DC. It was also Nikki’s vision that led me to enlist in her Air National Guard unit, where I gained the qualifications that then landed me a great civilian job. Nikki has created a wonderful family life for us through her bold yet prudent decision-making process.. When I first met Gwendolyn “Nicole” Leon Gerro I was just going to meet up with the parents of a girl my daughter met in kindergarten and wanted to develop a friendship with. I did not know that I would be meeting someone who I now consider my best friend. Our families met at a local fast food restaurant with a play place so that we could get to know each other and see how the girls interacted. Our family of six and her family of 4 sat down together around the beginning of dinner and before we knew it, it was closing time. Our families hit it off right away. From the beginning, I saw Nicole as a confident young woman who was true to herself. She had strong core values, which I admired. I see Nicole’s character traits in her children as well, and I know it is because of the values she has instilled in them. Nicole is a wonderful mother. She puts the needs of her children first, but also finds time to take care of herself, which is not easy when you are a working mom, have your children in sports, and your husband travels for work. Nicole has shown me how to be a better me by balancing it all and still take care of myself. Nicole inspired me to take time for myself by joining her for a run during our sons' hockey practice and introducing me to a yoga class, as well. While assisting my son to get ready for practice, I knew if Nicole didn’t come, I would not run and instead put my work before my own health. Nicole was always there when I needed her. During our runs, I wanted to stop but because Nicole was there, right beside me, I did not. Her positive attitude and words of encouragement helped me find that inner strength to reach my goal. She led me to do more for my health, which in turn made me a happier person, a better wife and mother, and a more productive worker in the long run. Nicole’s positive attitude about health and fitness is contagious. She seeks and shares new and challenging ways to be fit. She smiles through the sweat when we work out, if she wanted to give up, she does not show it. Because of her attitude, I have learned to give myself some time to take care of myself by exercising, which has helped alleviate emotional stress as well as become more physically fit.. As a parent, Nicole is patient, consistent and caring. With Rodney, she has instilled a love for family and a core set of values. It is because of those ideals that her family is able to face challenges together. Nicole is always looking for ways to encourage her children to be their best and leads by always doing her best. When Rodney changed jobs and he needed to begin traveling for work, I knew it would be a change for Nicole. You don’t realize how much you depend on your partner until they are physically not able to be there. I thought the transition would be difficult for her. Once again, Nicole accepted the challenge. She developed a plan for her family to be successful. She knew the best thing for her children was consistency and patience. She worked hard to continue established routines. Nicole was able to balance her career and family with what seemed ease. Nicole's son Ryan needs more home support to be successful in school than most students. Nicole makes it a priority to be Ryan’s advocate, while working side by side with his teachers to establish accountability. With her ultimate goal being Ryan's academic independence and positive self-esteem, she researched his needs and found professionals to help her support Ryan as his parent and help Ryan to understand his strengths and weaknesses. It is human nature to hope things will work out in the end; however, Nicole put the hard work in to ensure Ryan will meet his goals. Because of this, I have seen Ryan grow socially and emotionally. He has developed into a happy young man, who cares about others. As a real estate agent, she works hard to continue established relationships with previous clients and develop new relationships with future ones. In her career, Nicole finds the relationships she builds with her clients just as rewarding as a potential sale. Her clients trust her for her know how and her connection with them. She singlehandedly organizes a number of appreciation events for her past, present and future clients. With Rodney being away, it goes without saying that she had to stay strong for her children, and stay focused on her career. Nicole also had to be there for Rodney. She knew that even though he was away, he was missing his family. Nicole had to put aside the stress she had and be sure Rodney knew that he was important and missed. Making time for phone calls and planning family trips to for when he got home, gave the family something to look forward to instead of focusing on his absence. Nicole’s ability to juggle everyone else’s needs are a true testament to her altruistic character. Because of her strength, she was able to find success in her career and also guide her family to continue to grow together despite being miles apart.. Nicole is the rock in her immediate family. She grew up in an environment that was less than nurturing. As a kid, she had to mother herself and her siblings. There are countless ways to show Nicole’s strength in adverse situations and selflessness in regards to her family. Nicole mentored her younger brother when he needed help transitioning to a better life and away from legal difficulties. She invited him in to her home and helped him get back on his feet. Never judging him; Nicole assisted him in becoming gainfully employed and develop short and long term goals for himself. When Nicole’s estranged father passed away, she traveled many miles to attend his services. Upon arrival not only was she met with his family’s emotional grief, but financial struggles as well. She was notified that her father would not be able to be properly buried because there was no financial means to do so. Nicole knew there was only one thing she could do. She dug deep in her own wallet and gave her father a proper burial. She did not do it to be the hero. She did it because she knew it was the right thing to do for her father. Nicole often finds herself as the role of parent when interacting with her mother. She often needs to support her mother emotionally and financially as well. This can be draining on a child. Nicole cannot look to her mom for sound advice. I believe this is why she works so hard to be a good mom. Instead of dwelling on the circumstance, she uses it to inspire her to be the best mom she can be for her children. Nicole is the foundation of her family. She looks adversity in the eye and takes it on. It is because of Nicole’s never give up attitude and set of core values that her family draws strength from her.. Most people have certain times when they shine and demonstrate their abilities as great supervisors, wingmen, or tip of the spear troops. I personally think you function in that zone all the time. One time that was reflecting of this was when you told me about the way you handled the confrontation with SSgt Reagan and Capt Match. It is one thing to be able to council a subordinate troop or airman, but when you are placed in a situation that pins you against a higher ranking individual things become more of a challenge. I was impressed that you remained professional when talking to Capt Match, especially because he wasn’t told the entire story and you were made to look like the bad guy. Also, explaining to him where he should have come to you first as a SNCO; and how confronting you in front of the SSgt undermined your authority and credibility.. Like the previous story, being professional and knowing how to handle a situation is a great strength to have. However, I am the most impressed on how you are able to stand your ground when you believe in something you feel to be right. One instance of this was during drill weekend and we had SNCO call where we discussed the fact of having personnel on MPA orders attend drill weekends (even if they work shift rotations). Many times people don’t get to see when someone fights for their equities, even when it comes at the cost of upsetting the bosses or higher ranking members of the unit. You continued to let leadership know how you felt about the situation and why you felt that this was going to be an injustice done to those folks. Even though little came from it, I think people definitely continued the conversation behind closed doors and the topic remained on the table a little longer with your help.. The third story is not as much of a story but more of a conglomeration of times. Your ability to recognize when you don’t know everything and search out assistance in others is one of your best qualities as a person and military professional. There have been numerous times that you have come to me to either bounce an idea off me or even ask a simple question like how an EPR bullet that you wrote sounds; or even the tougher questions like how should the enlisted members in Ops be structured to give them a better chance for growth and enlisted career development. More often than not, I’ve seen you ask the right questions then take off and run with the facts and create a great idea from it. My favorite commanders and mentors that I’ve worked with have had this quality, and to me it’s what makes them great leaders. Mainly because they listen to the people that are in the dirt doing the job and then create something better from it.. One of the first memories that I have of Gwendolyn (also known as LG) is the perseverance she has when faced with a task or situation that she is unfamiliar with, inexperienced in, or lacking confidence in her own natural abilities. When I first met LG, she was on orders with her Air National Guard (ANG) Unit and assigned to the National Reconnaissance Operations Center (NROC) of the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO). Her roles and responsibilities changed dramatically when her Active Duty (AD)counterpart departed and LG was thrust into the role of NCOIC of Current Operations. While the role of an NCOIC was certainly commensurate to her rank of SSgt, LG had recently retrained into Space Operations and was assigned to an organization with mostly senior ranking officers (most of which had an ego the size of the state of Virginia) and far more “operational” space operations experience then her. LGs role was to ensure that daily operations continued uninterrupted, navigate the endless flow of new operational requests and requirements, learn her new Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC), and provide a seamless transition for the inbound active duty NCOIC. To say that LG was successful at meeting the requirements of her role as the NCOIC of Current Operations would be a gross understatement of her success. During her time, she earned two operational certifications, helped develop and implement a training program to certify new operators in both certified positions, managed an ever changing 24x7 crew schedule that was comprised of senior government officials (GS-15), enlisted and officers (A1C – Lt Col) from the AD, ANG, and Reserve components, as well as the Army and approximately 20 full-time government contractors, and implemented new processes that streamlined the administrative burden of operations. Her success can be attributed to many things to include natural talents, intelligence, and maturity...it was her perseverance that pushed her over the top. As the incoming NCIOC, I can say with firsthand knowledge that not only I but the NROC and her ANG Unit benefited from her success.. While Gwendolyn (aka LG) has many strengths, and has displayed these strengths during her time as an NCO and Senior NCO (I’m sure as an Amn too, I just didn't know her then) ...her ability to prioritize and focus on what is truly important in life is a strength that I have always admired about her. Her ability to prioritize the important things in life has played a significant role in both her personal and professional life...and she has done it with grace and confidence. When LG returned to her role as a traditional Guardsman she quickly and easily transitioned to a new career as a government contractor making a healthy wage supporting a mission that she loved. However, the life of a contractor can quickly impact a healthy work/life balance...especially when you’re expected to perform a rotating 12-hour shift schedule. While it is common in today’s world for both parents to have full-time careers and for the children to adapt and overcome the hectic schedules that are thrust upon them between their parent’s schedules and of course the crazy schedules that kids have with school and the associated after school activities. Unlike most people though, LG was able recognize the impact her new career was having on her and her family and took action to remedy the problem even though that meant resigning from a career that would have been filled with many accomplishments. While many may not see this as a strength, it is imperative that a leader is able to recognize the impacts from their decisions and take the appropriate actions to remedy the negative impacts it has on personnel (to include themselves). I hope that should the day come that I am faced with the same challenge LG faced, that I will be able to make the right decision without fearing the change.. One strength that Gwendolyn (LG) has displayed in every facet of her life is her compassion. She is always there for anyone in need...strangers, coworkers, friends, and family. Always willing to lend a hand or more importantly, an ear when needed. While I have many stories of her compassion, the one that hits closest to home is one that impacted me the most. Shortly after LG and I met, she learned that my father had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and recognized the challenges that I was having coping with the diagnosis and routinely inquired on how I was doing and what she could do to help. As my father’s health quickly deteriorated and following his death, LG was there...day and night, for me, for my family...anything we needed she was there. Her support has never wavered and still to this day, 6 years later, she continues to “check-in” on me during the holidays and the anniversary of his passing. Going through a personal tragedy is and always will be hard but having someone like LG around during those trying times makes them bearable. I can say that I am thankful to have such a compassionate friend, coworker, and fellow Airman!",14

You cannot buy it; you cannot make it; and you sure cannot fake it. Anthony's charisma is not limited to the way he looks. The way he moves, how he stands with confidence, and his presence in a room of strangers captivates. Anthony has a natural ability to capture the hearts of anyone who is lucky enough to cross his path. When I first met Anthony I thought he was just being assertive because I was his brothers girlfriend. But over the last few years I have watched him walk into multiple internships, weddings, and parties and walkout with a handful of new friends. During my sisters wedding in October 2016, he sat at a table with complete strangers and each time I looked over he was engaged in deep conversation or laughter with complete strangers. By the end of the night my grandparents were smitten by him, and started inviting him to Thanksgiving dinner. All opened their doors and hearts to him. To this day, my parents always ask ""how is Anthony, ""followed by my grandparents, siblings, and friends. Anthony has a unique kind of charisma that out shines the brightest movie-stars, it is something that is hard to describe. Instead, its one of those things that you know and feel it when you experience it.. Undoubtedly, Anthony is the smartest person I have ever met. In fact, I refer to him as the walking encyclopedia. If you want to know something about sports, ask him. If you want a piece of American history, ask him. If you want to know why the grass is green and the sky is blue, chances are Anthony knows the answer. One of our favorite past times as a group is quizzo. Here is where Anthony's vast range of knowledge truly shines. He spits out answers to every questions, and even in moments of self doubt Anthony perseveres, and remarkably provides the correct answer. It is because of Anthony that we have won quizzo multiple years in a row. They say knowledge is power... but Anthony doesn't see it this way. Instead he takes the time to invest in his education, absorb the knowledge, and apply it to the real-world.. Loyalty to your friends and family is the greatest virtue you can have. There are not many families who are put together like the pieces of the Iannarelli's. Throughout my life I have never seen a family who loves and respects one another the way Anthony and his family does. Part of this reason is because Anthony and his siblings were raised with dignity and morals, and more importantly unconditional loyalty to one another. He fosters these qualities with whom he associates. Anthony's loyalty presents itself in many colors. Whether its a hole in your ceiling that you need fixed immediately, a ride to the airport, or an ear to listen Anthony is the one person you can consistently rely on to have your back. His friends also know this quality all towel. There are not many people who have had the same group of friends since they were in preschool. However, Anthony has been so loyal and honest to his, that to this day they are as close as they were when they were kids running around a playground. Anthony lives in such a way that if you question the definition of kindness, integrity, and loyalty, people will answer with his name. Sure blood makes you related, but its Anthony's loyalty that makes the Iannarelli's and his friends family.. Anthony is  one of the most intelligent and hardworking people I know. In school Anthony excelled and was always the top in his class. No matter how much work he had to do, he always managed to get everything in on time and always received phenomenal grades and feedback. He attended the University of Penn which is one of the most prestigious universities around. While attending college, Anthony did an internship in Washington DC and also worked part-time. To say I am proud of him would be an understatement. After college he has been working several jobs with early morning and late nights to provide for himself. He worked hard up until the day he left for training school. Anthony was always my “go-to” guy - he was always willing to lend a helping hand, help me with handy work, watching my daughter, or just providing me with the knowledge I needed to get my work done - and he always will be that way. Anthony treats everyone with kindness and he is always there to help.. Qualities: Always there for family and friends N ever gives up thoughtful and caring Honest and reliable on time and dependable Natural born leader Youthful and friendly Memories: Bubble gum before Fox Rok Football Reenacting ""take it to the limit - newcomer steal the show"" Ocean city vacations and Brown's Donuts"" That's a big telescope"" Head of the back of the tail in there and Pajama Same eating boxes of cereal in one day Respect, responsibility, and reverence at dinners. Whether I forgot to put the marshmallows in my rice Krispy treats...Or if I was lost down town and needed directions...Whether I didn’t know how to turn off my emergency brake...Or how to change the oil in my car...Whether I needed someone last minute to watch Carina...Or asked for furniture to be built...Whether I locked myself out far away...Or asked for a room to be painted...Whether I needed a shift covered...Or a paper to be checked...I could always count on my friend. My brother, Anthony, to be there.. Anthony has demonstrated from an early age in grade school the ability to learn and apply what he had learned in everyday life moments. One example is when Anthony started playing sports. Anthony showed a strong sense of leadership on teams tempered with the ability to use common sense judgements when dealing with teammates and treating others with respect.. Anthony learned from his Father the importance of giving back to others. Anthony took part in many community service projects with the Kiwanis Club of Phil-Mont. This provided Anthony with a sense of self-worth in sharing his time and talents with others thus keeping him grounded and aware of the needs of others.. Anthony has developed a well rounded understanding of working with his hands as well as his mind. Anthony who is a quick learner- by watching and hands on work with auto repairs as well as working for a home contractor. The knowledge gained from expanding his talents and a sense of pride in doing the work yourself and helping others will help Anthony with everyday life challenges.. One of the best stories I can share about Anthony took place a few years ago. I believe that his actions in this story really capture who he is as a person. Anthony and his friend were at a restaurant together. They enjoyed a nice meal together and then when they got up to leave, they realized that his friend left her purse inside the restaurant. They went back inside to get it, but it was not there. They went to ask the employees who were working there if anyone had turned in a lost purse. Nothing. They then asked if they had seen anyone who might have taken it. They weren't positive, but the workers said that some people who were sitting near them had just left and maybe they had taken the purse. Without hesitation, Anthony went outside again to see if he could find the people who had taken it. He saw them in the distance getting on to a public transportation bus. Anthony boarded the bus, paid his fare and took a seat among the other passengers. He saw the alleged burglars sitting in front of him. He called his friend who was with him and advised her to follow the bus until he could make sure they in fact had the purse. They had not noticed him from the restaurant and he was able to maintain a low profile. After a while, he saw on of the alleged rummaging through the purse. Once he saw this, he communicated to his friend tailing the bus to contact the police and let them know what was going on. After a while, the police arrived and pulled the bus over. They asked Anthony to point out the thieves and the police escorted them off of the bus. The purse was recovered and the thief was arrested. This story demonstrated to me many of Anthony's best attributes: confidence under pressure, integrity, justice and bravery.. Another story I can share about Anthony took place when he was just 12 or 13 year sold. He joined the local community football team. He had played in prior years but this season was, in my opinion when he really shined. He was one of the quarterbacks on the team. Early in the season, the coaching staff decided to start the other quarterback. This did not discourage him though. He continued to practice every day and really came into his own. The first few games went by and the team was doing alright, but they weren’t really playing as a team. The quarterback who was starting was a hot head and let his teammates know his frustration with them. One game early in the season, the starter went down with an injury. It was Ant’s time to get into the action. He got in there and finished the game with conviction. During the next week of practices, I could see the players loosening up and playing with more enthusiasm under Ant’s leadership. Rather then getting frustrated with his players when they made mistakes, he simply encouraged them to do better next time in a supportive way. Soon, they were playing really well. They looked like they were having fun out on the field. Even when Ant got banged up, he didn’t take it out on his offensive line or blame others, he just got up shook it off and went on to the next play. Eventually, the original starting quarterback's injury healed and he was able to play again. The coaching staff decided that they were going to keep Ant as the starter though. They saw his skill, confidence and leadership in the prior weeks and they loved what he brought to the team. They didn’t win the championship that year, but it was a great season, and the team’s attitude was completely different by the end. They started playing with a lot of heart. I attribute a great deal of that to Ant's leadership.. Another time Anthony was at his best was very recent. Our parents had recently decided that they wanted to move. They are both older and not very physically capable. There was a lot of work that needed to be done to the house before they could sell it. Ant knew that our parents could not fix the house by themselves, so he took it upon himself to do a lot of the work for them. He was there everyday by himself fixing things, painting, moving boxes day in and day out. He knew he wasn't going to get paid for any of the work, but he didn’t mind. He sacrificed all of his free time, even though he knew he would be joining the Air Force soon. He didn't complain or get angry that he was spending so much time doing this, he did it because he knew it was the right thing to do. His dedication to his family and everything he commits to is unquestionable. Miss you buddy.. I have known Anthony for over 10 years. One of my first experiences with Anthony was as his grade school baseball coach. As a coach, I can say Anthony was not made to be a baseball player, but even as a young child, maybe 12 years of age, Anthony did not let any lack of talent stand in his way of stepping onto the field. The team he played for was not a great team, and also did not fully have the support of the school. No matter the adversity his team faced, Anthony always stood in the box, performed to the best of his ability, and never let defeat bring down his motivation to keep playing.. Anthony is the smartest person I know. He graduated first in his class in high school, as well as second in his class at a prestigious Ivy League University. I being 6 years older then Anthony, started my college career after he had already completed his. Even after going through an unbelievably hard college program that he more than successfully completed. Anthony would always be there to help answer my questions and guide me through some of my trials in starting college later in life. Anthony was never too busy to help anyone with anything. He truly performs service before self in every aspect of life.. As a prior service enlisted Air force member. I clearly remember how stressful and nerve racking the enlistment process was, from first stepping foot in to a recruiters office, to the pain staking periods of just waiting to here what your future in the military held. I myself had a very long delayed entry period to basic training, and I still remember that to be one of the most stressful and hardest times of my life, wanting so bad for something to happen but just hanging in the moment waiting for an answer. Anthony also had moments of delayed periods in his enlistment, but he never let those times break his focus and determination. What impressed me most is that Anthony never took the easy route to his enlistment, when an opportunity arose, he never backed down from it, even if it meant delaying his entry even further, or taking a risk that could push back his dream of enlisting. Anthony never backs down in times of stress or term oil, and has shown strength and wisdom to me beyond his years.. You have displayed leadership through your ability to take charge in stressful situations. There are two specific occasions that stand out to me when I think of you taking initiative in less than ideal scenarios. The first occasion was when you and I were walking in University City by Penn's campus. I wasn’t paying attention and forgot to look both ways before crossing the intersection. Luckily, you were able to take control of the situation by grabbing my ponytail to pull me back before I crossed. This story is known to be quite comical, however it is evident that in that moment you took charge. There was a split second of opportunity and you were able to muster up the courage to do the right thing, and for that I am very grateful! A similar situation of distress was when you and I were out to eat at Chipotle and my purse was stolen. Despite the circumstances and crazy course of events, you were able to stay calm and collected throughout everything – from getting on the bus to talking to the police, you took control of the situation. You helped those in need (akame) feel calm. While the ordinary person would panic in these stressful situations, you demonstrate your ability to remain stable, yet determine an immediate course of action. You are a good leader because you have the ability to remain calm, while also finding a solution to the problem.. You have displayed leadership through your ability to be enthusiastic and passionate. I have seen you passionate and enthusiastic throughout various aspects of your life. While at Penn, you sought out the opportunity to be a part of the Penn in Washington group. Once you landed your internship, you jumped in head first and were always looking for ways to learn more and do more. I remember you telling me how you stayed late to help out even when it wasn’t necessary. You are always going above and beyond, not just for your own personal benefit, but for the benefit of others as well. While at Old Navy, you were admired for being positive and upbeat... even though we all know working in retail is the least exciting job to have. You even went beyond your associate responsibilities to help the managers count the money and close. Working for Bob, you would come early and stay late, helping meet deadlines and finish projects, not to mention, you would genuinely get excited about starting and finishing jobs. Not everyone has the ability to be so passionate about mundane tasks and responsibilities. You combine your positive outlook with drive to work hard and follow through, no matter how many hours you must put in and no matter how many obstacles may stand in the way. In a sense, you become emotionally involved in helping and doing, which as a result creates enthusiasm. You are a good leader because you have the ability to believe in something, and work hard to attain it.. You have displayed leadership through your ability to be empathetic. There are numerous times when you have displayed empathy – by putting yourself in someone else's shoes. Being able to see a point of view from someone else’s perspective is crucial to being a good leader. I think this goes hand-in-hand with your desire to help others. I joke that you over-extend yourself at times, but you genuinely are always looking to help out other people, which is a truly admirable trait. I believe that it is your empathy that makes you have a desire to care for others – and by caring, you take the time to listen and build trust with people. You are a good leader because you seek to understand and be supportive of others.. Anthony is a young man who shows intelligence, initiative and sense. He gained our confidence and trust with his abilities and his work ethic. Anthony was extremely dependable and was always willing to take on new challenges no matter how large or small. He handled various tasks for three other staff members and me. Some of the larger projects included coordinating large department mailings, cataloging the department's art collection and working with us on various conferences/workshops. Anthony not only worked well with the staff, but with the faculty as well. In the Mathematics Department he was exposed to different personalities and styles of work.. I always remember Anthony's calm demeanor and sense of humor. He has an easygoing laugh and a smile that puts everyone at ease. He was very good at talking to students who came to the office with various problems. If he didn't know the answer he never hesitated to ask questions. But some of my favorite memories was when we had a few minutes just to chat. We share stories about our families and when he spoke about his family his face would light up. He was always very proud of his family. The summer after his job in Washington DC was a real turning point for Anthony. You could see how much he enjoyed working in the US House of Representatives. The experience gave him a real passion and drive that carried through his final year her eat Penn. Anthony's graduation from Penn was a proud moment for my staff and me. We watch a young man grow in so many ways. We've had a number of students work for us over the years and only a few will remain in our hearts and minds - and Anthony is at the top of that list!. You can use any list of superlatives to describe Anthony: the most..., the best, etc. He has succeeded at everything he has set his mind to throughout his life. One of the key characteristics that enables Anthony to succeed is his determination. In grade school, Anthony was determined to be the best football quarterback. He did research, he printed out statistics of players on the Eagles, he practiced. During every Eagles game on a Sunday, Anthony, Mike, Andrew, Dennis, Nick, and anyone else that was over to watch the game, would run out into the street during halftime to play a quick pick up game. Of course, Anthony was the quarterback, and he'd throw his heart out, hoping to make a pass that would score his team a touchdown. He played for our local Fox Rok team for several years, always striving to do his best. He'd go to practice after school every day, and still manage to get all of his homework done. On Saturday's we'd all travel to see his games, whether they were close by or if they were away. Before each game, Anthony would run around the field, making sure he was stretched, and, more likely, to ensure that he'd still be within the weight limit to play that day's game. He'd run out onto the field, either pass or throw the ball, run to see how the play ended, and then run to the sidelines to converse with his coach about the next play. He faced some setbacks during his football career, but he'd come back stronger, with his flak jacket or his helmet shield, making sure he could still get out there any play the game.. When Anthony was in high school, pushing for that number one spot in his class, he applied to the University of Pennsylvania, and intended to start out pre-med. After taking a couple classes, he realized that that was not what he wanted to study. Eventually, he landed upon political science. He'd text me or tell me about his classes and about his professors, telling me about the books he was reading, and asking me to proofread a paper. He truly enjoyed his classes and the topics about which he was learning. Every once in a while, when I was proofreading a paper, not really making too many comments or edits, I'd think to myself how lucky he was! I loved reading his papers, and wished I was in those classes, learning those topics, too! He probably did not think he was lucky; he had to write the papers! Eventually, he decided that he'd participate in an internship in Washington, D.C. He packed up, not really knowing the city, or anyone in it, and moved down to DC for a semester. He excelled at his position, and did well in his classes while in DC. I think that first internship really sparked something in Anthony, because he also served in two more internships. I think his quest to learn new things and his desire to excel helped him pursue these internships. For his last internship, he was able to write a summary that became part of the congressional record. He was so interested in serving in this position, and gaining the valuable experience, he even found an apartment on his own in College Park, Maryland and took the metro into town every day. It is apparent to me that his time on Capitol Hill shaped Anthony, and opened his eyes to new possibilities for his future.. Anthony used to work for a gourmet food store and caterer during high school. In addition to working in the store and catering, he'd perform small odd jobs for the owner to make some extra gas money. On one occasion, his boss had left him the car keys, and asked him to pull his car out of the garage and wash it. Anthony dutifully accepted the keys and went to pull the car out of the garage, only to find that the car was manual, not automatic, like he was used to driving! He had never driven a stick shift car before, but that did not stop him from learning! He whipped out his cellphone, and watched a handful of how-to videos on YouTube so that he could successfully pull the car out of the garage to wash it. His ingenuity, and his ability to think fast in this situation enabled him to complete his task as requested.",24

I have decided to focus on three character traits that I think are your strongest and ones that I wish that I was better at. You need to know that I love you and you are one of my best friends in this world and I pray for your success and happiness. I believe in you and I support you in all that you do that is good and praiseworthy. Probably your strongest trait is determination. Once you have an idea in your head it doesn't leave you until you have accomplished it, no matter any setbacks you face. The strongest example of this is your lifelong dream to become a pilot. As far back as I can remember this has been one of your goals in life. It has always impressed me how you have found a way to accomplish this goal by getting your private pilot license, getting your education, and pursuing your career in the Air force. Even though your current career path does not necessarily put you into a pilot’s seat I have a feeling that you are not finished with this goal. One memory that has always stuck with me that illustrates this point comes from one of your high school soccer games. In this game, I believe you were either a defender or midfielder. You had the ball and was bringing it up the sideline when a player from the other team stole the ball from you. Instead of throwing your hands in the air and being defeated you decided to turn and run in front of the other player and then throw your entire body in front of the ball and the feet of the other player causing him to go head over heels over you with you ending up with the ball. You were determined to not let him steal the ball and get away with it. From my experience in life the people I have known that are extremely successful in life are the people with this trait.. Another strength of your that has always impressed me is your ability and desire to learn new things. One example of this is your interest in solar and alternative energy. When you are interested in something you don’t just scratch the surface of the subject you dive in deep and learn as much as you can. I am always impressed that every time I see you that you have a new idea and project with solar. When we talk about it I am also impressed with your knowledge from self-study. This is another character trait that I have seen highly successful people demonstrate.. Another strong skill of yours is that you are a hard worker. It is rare to see you be still for very long. You are always moving and working on something. I have always been impressed with your determination to provide for yourself. Whether you are picking up shifts at the base, driving for Uber, or any other odd job you find. When you get started on something I don’t know of many people who can work harder and as fast as you do. Again, I think that your shining example of this is your desire to become a pilot. Most people would have not been able to put in the hard work you must to accomplish this goal. My experience in life is that hard work is the investment required to achieve great success in this life. Continue to work hard and you will continue to be successful. I am excited to see the great things you are going to accomplish. Please know that I am always here for you and I will do my best to help you. I want to see you be truly happy and will help you in any way that I can.. To begin this odyssey into Robert Cornia’s life experiences I would suggest that I start with what I remember about his boyhood. Robert was an individual that liked to figure out how things worked. He would often tinker with small devices often taking them apart to see what made them tick. One of his earliest fascinations was how pipes moved water. We gave him a set of PVC pipe cut into various lengths and a box of joints, elbows, and tee’s and turned him loose in the back yard. He would spend hours setting up different combinations of twist and turns and patterns. With these he would experiment to see how many ways he could get water to move through the pipes. Robert’s favorite television shows were those which were either engineering or science oriented. He would often try to duplicate many of the experiments he saw on TV. He once viewed a program of the building of the Golden Gate Bridge and the engineering that went into it. Consequently he got out his connects building set and proceeded to build his own model of the Golden Gate Bridge. By the time he was through with it the supporting towers were at least four feet high and the road base spanned eight feet in length. He was very proud of his accomplishment and got permission to show it off in his class at school. His teacher was surprised at the size of this project when we took it in for show and tell. Robert has always had a fascination with flying objects. His first real experience with this was the purchase of a Mylar blimp toy with electric motors that could be remotely controlled. He spent hours gaining mastery of the flight controls. He was allowed to take it to his JR High and fly it in the Gym during assembly’s. From these experiences he gained a lot of positive peer recognition. As parents we were very proud and supportive of Robert in the many different ways he expanded his vision of life.. The primary activities that shaped Robert’s high school years were soccer, Boy Scouts, and Civil Air Patrol. Robert loved to play soccer and started to play the game in elementary school. Robert was a member and played with the Twin Falls Rapids Soccer Club and the Twin Falls High School Soccer Team. He had a passion and a love for the game. The coach of his Rapids Soccer team had high praises for Robert as he improved his skills and abilities. As I watched Robert play I could see how he relished the game. He was an aggressive player and not timid in going up against opposing players. I was privy to watch Robert’s athleticism grow during this years. Robert love for the game continued as he has joined several indoor soccer leagues and has captained several teams. Of all my five sons Robert was only one who was committed enough to earn his Eagle Scout Badge. He had a good Scout Leader that encouraged Robert to achieve the requirements necessary to allow Robert to lead others in accomplishing his Eagle Project. For his project he chose to build a solar calendar. A solar calendar is a calendar whose dates indicate the position of the Earth on its revolution around the Sun or, equivalently, the apparent position of the sun moving on the celestial sphere. Using a plan provided by his CAP leader, he proceeded to build the specific markers for the solar calendar. The calendar pieces were to be place on the lawn at the CAP compound. Upon completion of this project he was awarded his Eagle Scout Award. Because of Robert’s fascination with flying, he joined the local Civil Air Patrol Unit. He was an active member for at least two years prior to graduating from High School. During this time he participated and attended all of the activities promoted by CAP which include participation in local parades, community service, and a remote encampment. As part of Robert's participation in the program he earned the CAP’s Billy Mitchell Award. According to information that I have found only about 15% of all CAP Cadets achieve the Billy Mitchell Award. In order to earn this award a cadet must complete the first eight achievements of the cadet program. In addition, the cadet must pass a comprehensive 100-question examination covering leadership theory and aerospace topics. Because of his experiences in the CAP Squadron his goals to obtain his civilian pilot's license and to become an officer in the United State Air Force were created.. The first goal decided upon by Robert was the decision to obtain a Bachelor’s Degree in Airport Management from Utah Valley University out of Provo Utah. He made the decision to obtain this degree by taking on line classes rather than by attending campus classes. The reason for taking the on line courses was his objective to pay for his education without going into debt. Robert was able to find work at odd jobs. Many of the temporary jobs came from close friends who used him to perform maintenance at apartment complexes. Robert also took advantage of other temporary positions to help fund his education. Robert spent many long hours working on his course work, sometimes going long into the night. Robert looked toward the military as a way to help pay for his education. He finally decided on joining the Air National Guard out of Boise Idaho. His job in is unit was to be an electronics technician on the A10 Warthog Air Craft. Because of the educational benefits that were offered he was able to further his education. Robert still worked temporary jobs during the time between drills. As active duty days became available on base, Robert was one of the first to volunteer to fill these days. He was still able to meet his commitment to complete his course work. During the first couple of years in the Guard he was deployed to Afghanistan in support of his flying unit. Later he volunteered for an assignment in Bagdad, Iraq. Both of these assignments did not stop Robert from completing his course work. He just took his lap top with him and worked on his courses there. Robert has since then completed his course work and has earned his bachelor's degree. Through a lot of hard work, long suffering, and objective thinking he was able to achieve this goal which was a major stepping stone for other long range goals.. There are a lot of great qualities about Robert, it’s difficult to narrow it down to just three. However, there are a few that stick out to me the more than others. One thing, Robert, you are so goal oriented. Ever since I’ve known you, you have set goals for yourself, and regardless of how big or small they were, you made sure that you reached those goals. The way you talked about getting your pilots license, made me excited for you. You had planned it from the very start. You worked hard and were determined throughout your schooling, through all the long hours of studying, and your flight hours. You knew it would pay off in the end. And it did! The fact that you are so driven and passionate about the things you love, make those around you realize that with hard work you can achieve anything you set your mind to. You truly are an inspiration to everyone that you interact with.. Robert, another thing that sticks out to me how much knowledge you do have and your determination to gain more. If you don't know who something works or how to build something, you take the time to do extensive research on it. The fact that you you are that dedicated to learning, amazes me. Your thrust for knowledge is inspiring. The fact you go above and beyond to know something operates, whether it be an engine, a plane, a car or solar panel, and then either take it apart or make it better, is impressive. You're like a modern day MacGyver! The more you know about a subject, the better you can relate and explain it to those around you. You process things that you read in such away that makes you one of the best problem solvers I've ever encountered, whether it be the installation of a water heater for parents or assembling a simple dog fence that no one had thought to do it. I know that when it comes time for you to build your own plane, you will know exactly how to do it. Over the last few years, I have learned a ton of random facts from you, and in doing so, you have encouraged me to want to understand things better. Now I'm taking the time to do my own research on things, so when you talk about you building your plane or engines, or whatever it maybe I know what you are talking about.. Lastly, but certainly not the least. Robert, you are one of the most selfless people ever. You have such a big heart and you almost always put others before yourself. That is especially true when it comes to your family and friends. You are always doing things for others and never expect anything in return. From fixing small things around the house, to helping your brothers fix their cars. You are always the first to jump right it. You're always willing to help, even if one one asks you to. Those of us that are lucky enough to be around you, know how reliable of a person you are, day or night. Along with your selflessness amongst family and friends, you also know how to compromise in the work force to make the entire team stronger and make the plan better. Your son will know what it means when he is told that hard work will pay off eventually and he will have you to thank for that. As well as working hard, you giveback just as much to everyone that you help. It's a great example that you set for your son, nephews, nieces, and me. Charitable. Humble. Honesty. Those qualities can and will have a powerful impact on those around them.",9

An example of this is in reference to a shed that he just built in the back yard of his house. He showed a great sense of motivation to finish the construction of his shed within the time limits he set for himself. He not only achieved his goal, he also expressed his excitement in the way that he described the work he put into it.. Doug is the type of person that likes to teach others the skills that he has. Doug has taken up remote controlled aircraft flying as a hobby, which involves quite a bit of custom fabrication and knowledge required to understand the electronics involved in this hobby. I have also taken an interest in it, and he has helped me repair some of my own remote controlled aircraft. He not only helped me repair mine, he insisted on having me perform the repair myself and helped me understand how it worked.. From knowing Doug for many years I have had the pleasure of watching him maneuver through many difficult tasks as well as provide guidance to others when they are in need. One of these times Doug showed courage and selflessness, in this particular situation there was a dispute between two people and Doug overheard the dispute. When one person began to escalate the situation to the point where one became verbally aggressive. Doug was able to quickly assess the situation and make a sound judgement by maintaining an assertive and objective response. After Doug's swift reaction the situation was deescalated and the dispute was resolved. Doug showed selflessness by stepping in to help prevent these two individuals from making mistakes that would hurt them both without fear of backlash.. Doug has always looked out for me and had always had my best interests at heart, even when I didn’t think so at the time. One time I came to Doug with a serious problem and I was a mess I was so upset. I was scared of the situation and the outcomes it would bring and I needed someone to not only help me but also someone to talk to, I was in high school and too afraid to talk to my parents. When I came to Doug and explained my issue he offered his help and made me feel at ease and as though everything was back to normal and he did this without any type of hesitation. Doug has a way of taking you out of the situation you are in and helping you to see the different sides rather than just yours. By doing this he is able to provide an objective point of view and give you guidance to make the right decision for yourself.. Doug’s greatest strength is his determination. Doug’s determination to accomplish tasks and goals is inspiring. Doug is able to focus in on a goal and go after it until he gets it done. This skill can be seen in all aspects of his life whether it’s with his hobbies, job, or schooling. Doug strives to be the best he can be and does his best no matter what. This makes others want to not only work with and for him but do their best as well.. Douglas was a wrestler starting at the age of 4 all the way through high school and he was a state champion three times and a runner up his freshmen year. After taking state in his sophomore year the stakes were high to repeat, which he did. The added presser to repeat meant he had to work harder and Doug was willing to put in the extra time and spent many hours perfecting his skill. Being a wrestler takes a lot of hard work, dedication, and heart and Doug has all of these traits. Wrestling is a very complex sport because you can be tall or short, there is no advantage in a certain body type, and it comes down to technique. Pure muscle does not win a match alone and Doug learned this through the years. There was a time Doug was challenged to a takedown match by a much larger guy to test his strength and technical ability, and Doug was able to take his opponent down each time. After the match his opponent asked him what his secret was, Doug explained that he would watch to see when his heal made an imprint in the mat and he knew he could take advantage and shoot in to take him down.. Doug has a lot of vision, we call him our idea guy. When something does not work or you need a new way Doug can come up with a great idea. This is very true with his hobby of building and flying drones, he can take an ordinary piece of lightweight material and put it to flight. He started building and flying very young giving him great problem solving and analytical skills that helps him in his engineer career today. Doug can see life in something that others feel are ready to be tossed, he gets this from his grandfather, who Doug admired greatly and was able to teach him so many great skills.. Doug has a very helpful nature, he always ensures everyone is taken care of. There was a fire that spread to our neighborhood and everyone was asked to evacuate and after we had everything ready to move, Doug went to every house in our cul-de-sacto check on our neighbors and asked if anyone needed help getting personal items out. Doug was unhooking computers and helping others when the word came to we had to get out now.. I believe the true character of an individual is shown when faced with adversity or a setback and how that individual chooses to deal with the situation. In high school, Doug was in the final championship match in a large west coast wrestling tournament. He was well ahead of his opponent, clearly leading the match into the last round. Doug looked like he was having a great match, on his way to easily beating the best wrestler in his tournament bracket. Doug made a move and slipped off balance just for an instant, his opponent took advantage instantly putting him to his back. The referee slapped the mat for his opponent to get the pin and the winway too eagerly, not counting the required two seconds to have both shoulders flat on the mat. Doug lost the match. I then watched Doug get up and shake his opponent's hand to congratulate him on the match. Doug rose above the loss, held his head up high, confident in himself and never complained about the referee or losing the match.. Doug is a very loyal individual. An example is when he received an internship in a professional engineering firm. Doug worked for the firm his last year in college and graduated with a bachelor’s degree in civil engineering. The job market was great; construction was booming and most firms were looking for engineers. Doug could have easily shopped around for a higher paying job but chose to stay with the firm that had given him an opportunity to work as an intern. I see in Doug that loyalty and respecting who you work for is more important than pay.. Doug’s leadership abilities started showing through early. He was getting selected for higher positions of authority in ROTC and was appointed as the team captain on multiple sports teams. The coaches put extra responsibility on him because they knew he could be counted on. They even gave him keys to the school and equipment areas for access as if he were a coach or faculty. After school and weekends, Doug would come in and get things ready for the events and volunteer his time to teach and coach other students. In the Nevada Air National Guard, Doug quickly became the supervisor of the engineering section. He excels in his duties and responsibilities. When there is a problem, it gets assigned to Doug. For example, the squadron’s training program was lagging behind so the commander asked Doug to take it over and be the new Training Manager for the squadron. The program is now back on track and meeting standard. Doug loves serving his state and country. He volunteered to go on a six month Deployment to Kuwait. While there, he was put in charge of multiple large projects and was responsible for the initial design to the final construction. He is proud of his heritage and comes from a family full of military members including his father, grandfathers, sister, uncle and cousin. I would say military service is in his blood. In group settings, I have seen Doug providing input to the group, and if there needs someone to be in charge, the groups usually select Doug. He’s very unassuming, quiet and patient, speaks when needed, listens to others, helpful and is aware of the end goal.. I have seen Doug on numerous occasions at work be the first one to offer help toother employees even in instances where it is not work related and someone needs a ride or help with moving. Doug is a natural teacher, the hobbies that he has he is very happy to share with people and show people how to do them. He is a very encouraging person and when he is teaching you something you can tell he really wants you to learn and enjoy the new skill.. This is a story about Doug’s willingness and flexibility to get the job done whenever called upon. Doug provided valuable technical AutoCAD assistance in the design of abase pavement project. With little notice and in a short period of time Doug provided all 10 drawings necessary to successfully bid and execute a $300,000 asphalt project. He listened as a follower, provided excellent insight, and completed his multiple tasks each and every time with exceptional skill. He was a great member of the team and easy to work with.. This is a story that highlights Doug’s willingness to be the first one to work and the last one to go home at night. The project was at Fallon Naval Air Station. He asked that every member of the team show up at a certain time. He, on the other hand, would show up either the day before or at least an hour prior to the original showtime to get all the tools, material, and/or equipment ready for the job. He is always thinking multiple steps ahead. When the team got back to town that after he release each member to return home. Doug stayed late to ensure all the equipment was put away and that leadership was well informed of the progress for that trip. He finished out the duty day without once mentioning that he should go home. His dedication to duty is unrivaled.. The last story relates to Doug’s desire to be a good leader. A work order policy was established in our squadron due to a recent change of leadership. Doug took on his new role with 100% engagement. When a portion of the new policy wasn’t being followed that drill weekend he called leadership to follow up with the status. He was eager to understand the work orders for the drill so he could be prepared and provide the best leadership he could. At least that’s how I took it. He is an engaged leader that is ready to show his leadership skills as soon as possible. He is eager and ready for whatever is thrown at him.. I’ve had the pleasure working with Doug for a few years now and he is always a welcomed member of any project team I’m leading. One particular time where I found Doug to be at his best was during our Runway 8-26 Field Work. We were working on a closed runway, at an active airfield, with multiple crews trying to complete their given tasks. My role, with Doug, was first and foremost to supervise these crews to ensure our operation didn’t impact airfield traffic and to complete an engineering survey of the project area. I found myself with little time to complete my share of our engineering survey. Doug completed his portion of work, and without a mention, started picking up my slack. A day later, I had some time to pick up where I left off. I checked in with Doug and he told me it was done! Doug saw an opportunity to support the team, took initiative to complete the additional work, and did it competently. Doug was great all week, but we are used to Doug doing his share and doing it well. I was most pleased to see Doug take on a larger role, and push beyond the minimal expectation!. I’ve have very limited exposure to gun in my life and after some casual conversations with Doug he extended a standing invitation to go shooting with him. I took Doug upon his offer and was really impressed with Doug’s responsibility. Doug not only was happy to bring a few guns for me to use at the gun range, he took the time to show me the proper and safe way to handle a fire arm. There are a lot of people that I would not choose to learn from with regards to fire arms because they don’t show the proper care and safety.. I think character is very important in life because having character includes maintaining a good moral code, being respectful of other, and having social skills to comfortably navigate conversation with many personality types. While I don’t have one specific example, I’ve witness Doug show strong character in both personal and professional atmospheres. I’ve enjoyed many conversations with Doug. I’ve come to really respect Doug as a person because of his character!. I have known you for over a decade now and we have been together as a couple for 9years now. You are so many great things and more. I look up to you in many ways. One of those ways is as a person who can and will help me with anything in life, because you care deeply for me and would do anything just to make me happy and help me succeed in life. Even when I don't believe I am capable enough to do great at something, you encourage me to do great and feel confident in myself. A good example of this supportive and loving behavior is the time you helped me when I was very stressed/overwhelmed with my radiology technology studies. It was late in the evening after clinical for me and after work for you. I was tearful, convinced that I wasn’t smart enough, I needed to practice my examinations before the next day of clinical, I didn’t have enough time to get better by tomorrow, and I felt like I was struggling with the whole program at the time. You were ready for a good nights sleep and had to work early the next morning. You could have easily let me study on my own and I probably would have eventually gotten my confidence and gotten through clinicals that semester. However, you decided to stay up and help me cut up and tape together old file folders into the exact measurements I needed. You then allowed me to go from head to toe of practice exams with you, literally. The whole process probably took 2-3 hours long. I was able to feel way more confident in my skills that night instead of weeks or even months down the road. The last few weeks of my clinical experience went great because of that night. This is just one example of all the times you have helped me so much with my studies. You make mea better person, because you believe in me. Whether it was math, which is a subject you are very good at, or any other subject I struggled with throughout college, you have always offered to help me without hesitation and with immense patience. No matter how busy, far, or tired you were you found a way to help me succeed. I say far, because I remember the time you were deployed and were helping me through Face-Time and E-mail. This type of behavior takes a great deal of care for other people, a desire to see people succeed, and the patience to teach others. You have the ability to build other people's confidence to help them better themselves.. When Doug sees a complex issue, he does not shy away. He is quick to tackle the multifaceted problems with critical thinking like a true pack leader. I can rely on him to be there for me when I need him, even if I don't ask for help. There was one very rough time in my life where Doug was able to solve many problems with his quick actions to mitigate the situation from beginning to end. I had been simultaneously injured and lost my car due to a dumb driver who crashed into my car head on. Doug was there for me to take my car, pick me up, and take me home. The issue was I had lost my transportation to school and work. If I didn’t show up to class I would get kicked out of the Radiology Technology program. If I couldn't go to work I would lose my job and any chance of a future job with the Company. I was dealing with all of this on top of severe full back pain that I needed to treat, with no insurance and no desire to go into debt from medical bills. Doug thought quickly about the situation and pulled a few strings. He added me to his truck insurance enabling me to use his truck as transportation until I found a new car. He got rides home from work from co-workers until he got a family truck from Hawthorne within days of the incident. He is not afraid to make sacrifices like this in order to get what needs to be done, done. Once I found a car his truck would replace the truck he took from Hawthorne as a trade with a family member. Doug showed the ability to make the situation work for him and I in just a matter of days. As time went on the family member he had made the trade deal with was getting impatient and wanted the truck I was borrowing. With my tight school/work schedule I am still borrowing the truck. Weeks pass and more family members get involved and get inpatient. Doug was able to explain to them how important their role is in allowing me to borrow this truck. He eased their worries and answered their questions in a respectful yet firm manner. This was a true challenge that he conquered. He diffused the heated situation. Not only was Doug a great deal of help in solving my problems quickly, he was able to be supportive of me emotionally. He was also very understanding of my emotions and stress I was going through. When stressful situations like this involve many people who have different opinions and expectations it is tough to bring everyone together on the same page, to look at the big picture, and to go along with a plan they may not see as ideal. Doug was able to not only do all that, but stay calm and strong himself. This calm under pressure skill allows everyone involved to look to Doug as a strong leader who can handle anything and can help people come together for one common goal. He was stressed, yet he didn’t show it. His communication skills gave me more time to look for a car and gave his upset family members reassurance that everything is being done to the best of our abilities. Doug is able to calm and reassure stressed individuals while continuously moving the process forward to get to the finish line.. One day Doug decided he wanted to buy a shed, what ended up happening was that he built his own, two months before he left for OTS. Doug wouldn’t get the size he wanted for the right price. He couldn’t settle for an overpriced store bought cookie cutter shed. He loves a challenge, so it began. He also enjoyed the idea of creating his custom layout and making a better shed than the ones you can buy. He took his already existing skills of AutoCAD and drafted his own layout for the foundation, floor, walls, roof, windows, and doors. He also made a materials list to determine how much material he would need and how much it would cost. He had never built a shed before, but he managed to overcome each challenge of this project. He taught himself the skills necessary like how to lay tile roofing. He leveled and dug the dirt in the backyard after he drew out plans. He bought the material and was building the shed on his weekends and some weeknights after work. He stayed organized and determined. He finished before his departure just as planned and within budget. Not only is Doug able to manage a project from start to finish on his own. He knows how to create high quality work with a firm deadline and budget. He juggled work life, social life, home life, and this project with ease. He stayed motivated in order to meet his deadline. When he needed help he wasn’t afraid to ask for it. When he didn't need help he didn’t waste anyone’s time and made sure they knew it was a one person job. He delegated the workload to the people that helped. He had a vision and was able to clearly explain what he expected from them and when necessary, how it needs to be done. He knows how to work under pressure while staying calm and collected. This just shows how Doug is not afraid of a challenge, and is able to deliver on his well-planned ideas. He can tackle things on his own, but he works well with others as well. The people that helped him on his shed worked hard for him and felt appreciated. He is also very well liked and had no short inventory of people offering to help. I have no doubt Doug could lead any team he is in charge of. People see his strength and integrity and want to be a part of it.. One of my oldest & most virtuous friends, Douglas Del Porto has exemplified time &time again what moral fibers must be engrained in any leader. The first moment I feel I should share dates back to the Fall of 2009, when Doug & I first met in Basic Military Training for the Air Force at Lackland AFB in San Antonio, Texas. Although I had little perspective relative to the standards at which Del Porto held himself, I was immediately flabbergasted by his stoic & wise aura. My approach to BMT was to keep my head low & blend in, which I also felt was Doug’s intent; however, his formidable demeanor gave way to becoming a mentor, advisor, comrade, & friend to most airmen in our flight of 60.Once the dust settled from the initial culture shock of our new lives as Airmen, Doug& I quickly became close friends. I saw in him virtues only recognized in the highest echelons of military leadership, poise, & character. He not only emitted qualities of a strong leader, but something in me wanted to follow him. I wanted to learn from him, march like him, talk like him, & lead like him. It was apparent that being a leader was in his blood, & that he was born to be much more than the rest of the airmen in our flight. From our fleeting conversations that were always shrouded in fear of a Military Training Instructors discovery, I learned that Del Porto was a state champion wrestler, a third generation member of the Air Force, & was a very intelligent &observant man. I attribute my survival & success in the military to the examples Doug provided me.. While our friendship bloomed, Doug was kind enough to leave an open invitation tome as Technical Training at Fort Lauderdale, Missouri came to a close: if I ever decided to leave Active Duty, he had a position waiting for me with the Civil Engineering Squadron with the Nevada Air National Guard in Reno. I eventually found an opportunity to take him up on this offer, & decided to reach out to him after several years of limited communication. Without a moments apprehension, Doug hastily worked through nearly every detail with his leadership to render orders for me to PCS. Furthermore, Doug & his family housed me, fed me, got me a job, & took excellent care of me in this new environment. I could never have been able to successfully transfer from active duty to civilian life with out Doug's support. During this transition Del Porto exhibited countless qualities of an empathetic, considerate, & selfless leader. He was sensitive to my every need as a newly separated, vulnerable veteran, & I never felt without support or help.. My final story regarding Doug at his very best, apart from all of the countless exchanges, favors, conversations, & advice he’s passed onto me, was his assistance in helping me court my now wife & mother of our new born son, Onyx William Thomas. I had met my wife Hannah at a local bar & became completely enamored by her, & Doug, fortunately for me, listened to me drone on & on about her for months. Unbeknownst to me, Doug took it upon himself to track her down & communicate to her how completely head over heels I was, & that unless she got in touch with me, Doug would have to console me indefinitely. Without his courage & willpower to do what I could not, I would not have a beautiful wife & son today. Doug has inspired so many virtues in me, & I truly owe him a life long debt of gratitude. He is selfless, kind, empathetic, intelligent & loyal, & he has taught me what it means to be a man in ways that my own father hasn't. There are few days that go by in which Doug fails to practice the qualities of an excellent leader.",25

They are honorable people who consistently practice good character which includes compassion, loyalty, dedication, perseverance, and reliability. Burl Holland exhibits these attributes in his daily life. Burl has a strong dedication to family and friends. An example of this is when he made an unscheduled, hurried trip to travel from Alabama to Georgia to help a family in need. Last spring there was a wildfire in South Georgia that began in the Okefenokee Swamp and quickly scorched some 150 acres. This wildfire spread quickly and caused the evacuation of 60 homes just east of the Okefenokee Swamp. Burl didn’t hesitate when asked to drive to Georgia to help a friend’s family who was in the fire’s path. He left within hours of the phone call with a truck loaded with a chain saw, shovels, rakes and anything he could grab out of the garage to help clear the property of debris that could ignite and spread the fire. He then drove the 9 plus hours and when he arrived he began helping anyway he could. This not only included clearing any ground debris that could spark a fire but he also helped load the family's furniture in a trailer and he pulled that trailer to Florida, dropping it off at a relative's house and returning to Georgia. He kept up this pace for several days until the emergency had passed and he could return home. Burl’s integrity and good character is not limited to this one example but is exhibited on a daily basis.. Burl’s sense of loyalty was evident recently when Burl’s grandmother, Joan Summers, broke her ankle. He didn’t hesitate to travel to Tennessee to help her. This included taking his ill grandfather, Burl Summers, to previously scheduled doctors' appointments and making sure his grandmother was stable before he returned home. Burl’s grandmother and grandfather have always been important to him and in the past year he renovated a bathroom in their home to make it accessible to his grandfather. Due to his work schedule, Burl could only work on the renovation over a series of weekends, traveling from Alabama to Tennessee and back. This is just one example of Burl’s reliability and compassion.. The most important story to tell about Burl is one of dedication, perseverance and integrity and it is the most recent. This story is about Burl’s dedication to his country as evidenced in his career commitment in the Air National Guard resulting in his becoming a cadet in the 24th Training Squadron Officer Training School, Class 17-08.His perseverance is demonstrated in his determination to achieve physically and academically in OTS and his integrity is proven in the fact that he was chosen to attend OTS and become an officer in the Air National Guard. Rest assured Burl Holland will make an outstanding officer because of his good character and his dedication to this country.. Burl has the ability to bring groups together and get them to gel. He is focused on accomplishing the tasks at hand and creating alignment in the group.. Burl is fair and treats others with appropriate respect. Works hard to create strong teams that can accomplish goals together and while recognizing team leadership structure and dynamics, has the ability to understand and recognize the contributions of the entire team and the role the little guy plays.. Burl Holland, A Story of Perseverance, Service and Family- as viewed from a friend and Comrade In Arms Perseverance: What would Mr. Webster say about it? ""Steadfastness in doing something despite difficulty or delay in achieving success."" If we still looked at dictionaries, we'd see a reference to Burl Holland beside that entry, the epitome of tenacity and determination. In 2002, Burl was a young SrA, deployed with the NC Air National Guard as a loadmaster, doing excellent work, but with his eye on the future. His short term goal was to become an instructor loadmaster. Despite being told he would not go to instructor school for several more years, Burl tenaciously pursued his goal by being the very best loadmaster he could be and by answering the call each and every time the Guard called. Despite outdated traditions and stubborn personalities, Burl made it to Loadmaster Instructor school in 2004, well ahead of his peers. But that was just his short term goal, his big picture was to finish his degree. For many young men and women in this country, an undergraduate degree is awarded after four, or five, or (good Lord) six years. Burl's degree was not awarded, it was earned at UNC Charlotte while still being an Instructor Loadmaster and going on multiple combat deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. To say he took the hard road is an understatement. His determination and staying power enabled him to attain his goal of earning a degree. But what was he to do with that degree? What was his endgame? All along, Burl wanted nothing more than to be an officer, his true prize. Armed with his degree, Burl sought an officer position in NC, only to be shot down time and again because of those same old traditions and personalities. Again, he kept his eye on the ball, transferring units and job specialties in an attempt to reach his goal. Here I sit 15 years later, preparing to call him LT. That, sir, is perseverance.. Burl Holland, A Story of Perseverance, Service and Family- as viewed from a friend and Comrade In Arms Service: We all know it, we define it as a core value. It defines us as Airmen. Uncle Sam calls and we answer, no questions asked. For Burl Holland it goes beyond that, he doesn't just serve his country, he serves his fellow Americans and Brothers in Arms. I saw it first hand when deployed with Burl in 2002, the spring of 2004 and again in the fall of 2004. At first glance, three deployments in three years seems like going above and beyond the call of duty, but it's how Burl conducted himself while deployed that defines his character. As a relatively inexperienced duty loadmaster in2002, Burl's goal every day was to make the lives of his fellow crew members better by having every aircraft pre-flight inspection complete and loading underway before the crew ever showed up. Additionally, he was always prepared step in for a mission loadmaster if they were ill or needed a break. During the 2004 deployments he was a mission loadmaster, directly assigned to a permanent crew. Burl displayed his commitment to the mission and his fellow crew members by volunteering to fly additional sorties when other units were short loadmasters. Burl worked tirelessly within our crew to build cohesion and team effectiveness by reminding the rest of us we were there as a team and as individuals we could never attain success. Most of us got it; one guy (we'll just call him Mongo) was a slow learner, but Burl kept driving home the team concept, sometimes through positive reinforcement and other times through ridicule(standard aircrew behavior). By the end of our deployment Mongo finally figured out. Burl made Mongo, and all of us, better team players. His determination directly led to the success of our squadron, but more importantly, his service and dedication to his fellow crew members made all of us better Airmen, willing to go the extra mile for your brother.. Burl Holland, A Story of Perseverance, Service and Family- as viewed from a friend and Comrade In Arms Family: Where are we, who are we without family? Lost in the abyss, I would say. Family grounds us and always gives us a home to come back to. How important is family to Burl? Two simple examples: Burl's father, Russell, was a long-time member of the NC Air National Guard. Burl entered the guard to follow in his family's footsteps, to build the tradition, and take it to new heights. When presented with long-term civilian employment opportunities, Burl passed on those chances, opting to continue serving with his Dad. Burl returned to NC in 2012 after the crash of MAFFS7, where we lost several close friends. Despite everything going on in our everyday lives, he returned to lay all of them to rest. We lost comrades, brothers, and we are closer because of it. We are Family.. I remember the first time I found out about Burl's strength in leadership. We were ata BSA event called Arrow Corps 5. The leadership team was at the top of the mountain and the crew was not gelled and not functioning well. Burl stepped in and took charge of the operations and pulled things together well. The team formed and the job got done.. I guess I will start with when you were trying to get your Eagle Scout. You wanted to do clean up that cemetery near mom and dads house but someone said you couldn't. The dedication you put into getting your Eagle Scout was something to look up to. I was always amazed at all you did with the Boy Scouts. I know that took a lot of work and time, and you always stayed dedicated to it.. When Dad was in the hospital a lot you made sure to be there for Mom and Dad. I know it took time away from work and Terry and you still went to help them. You might miss family gatherings, but you are always there in the time of need. I know that if I ever need anything you will always be there.. All of the deployments you have been on I know was not easy but you always stay strong and brave. I am so proud to call you my brother and to brag about how brave you are and all of the deployments you have gone on.. Burl benefited from his years as a Boy Scout. He enjoys volunteering, leading activities and adventures to help the next generations by sharing his experiences and helping others create their own. It is admirable he gives back.. Burl enjoys spending time with others, enjoying simple pleasures such as a game of cards, dinner with friends, or sharing experiences. He also enjoys new adventures, traveling and experiencing new cultures, sightseeing, and local favorites. Burl makes you feel comfortable and welcome, a part of the family. I look forward to spending time with Burl, maybe sharing some of my favorite things to do or some of his.. Burl was put into a position of accepting a role much different than what he was hired to do. While this was not his background and required a relocation, he went in with an open mind. Knowing this was not his area of expertise, he solicited advice, dug in, learned a lot, and performed well in an unfamiliar environment. This challenged Burl and fostered a desire to succeed. I think this was one of Burl’s shining performances and not only proved to others he could overcome, but to Burl himself that he could do well outside his comfort zone. He did this without the benefit of a local support network. Very admirable indeed.. Years ago while Burl and I were backpacking within the NC wilderness we became disoriented. At the time neither of us had a tremendous amount of experience within this particular area. While question marks were my primary point of ""what-to-do-next"" Burl was nearly immediate in his actions. He was able to triangulate our position off terrain features and, within a degree of error, determine our location. We were able to find our way back to the trail and continued on with our trip. While it seems trivial in nature this same attitude and ability to lead has played out numerous times with Burl. In the twenty plus years, fifteen of which have been in the military, that I have known Burl his innate ability to lead others has always been present be it within direct leadership or indirect. Leadership is no small task, Burl's experiences in similar situations have proven his ability to lead and lead effectively.",16

Bow hunting for elk spending on average 15 days at a time in some of the most beautiful but rough and nasty country that the Pacific Northwest has to offer. 5 years ago on a hunt in the North Fork John Day Wilderness we were 6 days into a brutal hunt experiencing temperatures ranging from 30 degrees in the mornings to 95 in the afternoons. I was mentally and physically beaten down and wanted to head back to our base camp to sulk. Brandon and I talked in length on the pros and cons of staying out in the wilderness to do what we came to, hunt or go back to camp to sulk. Brandon’s willingness, dedication, positive outlook, and communication skills convinced me to push myself to stay on the hunt and endure the conditions. Due to Brandon’s leadership we killed two giant bulls that year and will be a hunt that I will never forget.. Salmon fishing on the Rogue River can be fun but at the same time be dangerous. People that explore the Rogue River on either a Jet boat or a Drift boat die every year pursuing fall and spring run fish. Brandon has taught me everything that I know about fishing and boating the Rogue River. He has spent countless hours with me teaching me the correct lines to take with my drift and jet boat so that I do not put myself into a jam. He has taught me the secrets of fishing for salmon and steelhead. Brandon has been very patient with me, answering all the questions I may have, leading river expeditions, and feeding me information that I can use on and off of the river. Through the leadership and experience of my friend Brandon I can now call myself a fisherman on the Rogue River both in a jet and drift boat.. Through the mutual love for the outdoors Brandon and I have spent a lot of time together hunting a fishing. One morning we thought it would be a great idea for Brandon, Matt, and I to take my newly purchased Jet boat down a treacherous stretch of the Rouge River. Matt and Brandon are both guides on the Rogue River and both know the river like the back of their hand. The goal was to spend a great sunny day on the river and hook into some springer salmon. New to the jet boat way of running a boat Brandon spent around an hour going over techniques with me on how to keep power in reserve in case you need it, always be on plane, pick a line and commit, are just a few of those things. Brandon is very patient and full of great knowledge about the river. Running up river my friend Matt told me to go right while Brandon was telling me to go left. Both of them are very experienced but through the confusion I almost hit a gravel bar if it was not for Brandon taking action and telling me to STOP,STOP the boat now! I listened and because of that we averted what could have been a horrible accident. After being shook up for a little bit we got our barring and headed to the next salmon hole which was down river. Fished for the remainder of the day. On our way back up river we noticed that my boat did not have the turning radius that was needed to perform a hair pin turn through a shallow section of the river. Stopped Brandon communicated to me the line that I should take and instructed me to get on plane and leave some power for reserve in case we have to power out to avoid an obstruction. Brandon and I 15 conversation on the line was what I needed to perform the line and get through a tough section on the river. Without Brandon's leadership, calm manner in stressful environments it could have been a bad day. Probably would have screwed the boat up or worse got someone hurt. Thanks to Brandon my boat is in great shape and so am I.. Brandon McGraw is at his best when he gets to go fishing. Brandon is a very good fisherman and has been doing it for some time with his good friends. They communicate about the best fishing lures to use, the conditions of the currents and best time to be out on the water. Many of his friends are guides on the Rogue River for fishing. So he took it upon his self to become a guide too. He took the leadership to study and sit for his license. Then he had to figure out what he needed in a boat for his clients. This was a large undertaking and requires some studying on all the boats out on the market and choose the correct and prober one. He picked a boat that is made in Medford. It is designed by guys that are guides themselves on the Rogue and has been an excellent choice because they designed the boat basically for the Rogue River in mind. His boat was selected with the thought of his clients in mind. For comfort, accessible to fish from and easy for him to help the customer learns to fish. This was a great undertaking and required knowledge and research. Brandon achieved this goal with ease and got all the players and resources together to make it a reality for him. He is good at it and it challenges him every time he goes out because you must respect the river and it present a new challenge every day and he has been in several situation of currents that if he had not acted quickly he would have put him and his clients in a dangerous situation. But he learns from these situations and is a very good guide.. Brandon McGraw is at his best when he is learning and challenging himself. He was very excited to join the air force. I was not sure why he wanted to do this because he had his degree and was doing very well at his job. I was also concerned with him adding too much to an already busy life. He had a goal to be an officer in the Air Force and serve his county. I have to say at first I was not as excited about his decision. But he set the goal and proceeded. He stared communicating with others in the service and got the information to enlist and was determined to get it done. So he took it upon himself to contact the recruiter and find out just what it entailed. He then enlisted which requires a lot of paperwork and testing. This task might seem simple to others but Brandon did it at a time that he had a lot going on. He had just gotten married, purchased a house and has also had a baby while working two jobs. But his leadership at work allowed this process to be somewhat smooth and his own personal strength and follow through to make it a reality. Brandon is very excited because his strong desire and motivation is making his dream come true. So two years later he is now at camp for his officer’s training.. Brandon is best when he is with his family. Brandon is one of six boys in our family. He is the oldest and is a natural leader. He is helpful and kind to his brothers. He is always showing them the latest fishing or hunting techniques of skills. He is also a very good hunter. They mainly hunt with a bow. That is a very difficult skill and extremely hard to get close enough to shoot a Deer or Elk. But he has gotten many. He loves being in a large group of people and communicates well with all of them. He is not shy he is very engaging and well spoken. We have large gathering as many as40 people. He is a great cook as well. He is such a perfectionist that his meals are well thought out and prepared perfectly. He consistently is improving his cooking skills by asking me and others how something is make, what the seasoning are etc. He is also a very good athlete. Swimming, hiking, sailing and running are all things he loves to do and being outdoors with his family and friends are his happiest moments. Overall Brandon is a very well balanced young man.. Brandon McGraw is a dynamic young man as evidenced by his organization of fishing trips he leads. He reviews and plans our journeys with regard to the logistics of transportation, fuel, food and necessary supplies to ensure a successful outing. We fish from his boat and he comes prepared to instruct his team with the latest techniques and tackle. I know I can personally rely on his ability to put us in the fish. The rest is up to us!. Brandon MeGraw has been an integral part of my family, the Gansbergs, since he was in high school. During the years he has been enthusiastic and available to us for many projects we have completed on our family ranch and at our family lake cabin. He cheerfully pitches in on any of the tasks we are confronted with and has been available whenever asked.. Brandon McGraw has recently become a father to a baby boy, Cameron. He shares household and child responsibilities with his wife as she is a full time worker in the Air Guard and must meet her time commitments as well. I have found him to be positive in the face of adversity and he has never shirked a task. I am very proud to be associated with Brandon McGraw. James F. Gansberg DVM. As a child Brandon started showing signs of responsibility and interest in admirablethings like the outdoors. This was always refreshing to see that he not only was interested in sports and other normal things like other kids, but he had a sharp inclination to learn about nature. He was very close to his grandfather and spent a lot of time with him exploring rivers, lakes, forests and the mountains. I believe he became “as one” with nature and that attribute has stayed with him his whole life. This early tendency was the beginning of Brandon showing that he had intrinsic ""Character” and “Integrity”.. Brandon was definitely at his best when it came to high school athletics. He always pushed himself beyond his limits during practices. He was excellent especially in football, track and baseball. He showed calm control and no fear. He was confident and that showed in his successes. This trait of self confidence and self control carried on into other endeavors such as work. He always quickly learned how to do things and always completed his tasks beyond expectations. This kind of intrinsic character has made Brandon successful in whatever he takes on.. For several years Brandon worked with me. We did sales and marketing together. Brandon learned how to do this work very well and quickly. Brandon is at his best when it comes time to meet new people and communicate with them. His personality is outstanding and people quickly take a liking to him. This is a trait that made him successful in sales. You would often hear Brandon talking to a new client about fishing or hunting. It is amazing how many men much older than Brandon showed an interest in his activities and expressed a desire to go with him on outdoor activities. Brandon makes friends quickly and they respect him for his friendly and intelligent behavior. In this same area Brandon demonstrated the admirable trait of resilience. When something bad happened he would get over it and continue to strive for excellence. There was one time right after college where he worked with me for a pretty long time for a man who turned out to be unethical. This man promised Brandon if he worked for nothing at the beginning that he would pay him later. Brandon and I both believed him. We traveled to San Francisco several times and Brandon was even required to do hard physical labor one time. At the end of the engagement the man claimed he never told Brandon that he would be paid and never paid him. Brandon shook that off and moved on. He never let it get him down he just kept moving forward. Another time Brandon was hired by a company I worked for as a sales representative. Brandon worked hard, put in long hours, traveled long distances and did an excellent job. It turned out that the man who was put in charge as our supervisor was incompetent. After nearly a year that man suddenly and without a valid reason fired Brandon. Brandon and I were both very upset over this. But Brandon moved on. He didn’t let it get him down. He showed superior character and worked hard at getting another job. He moved on and continued to be successful in what he did.. Brandon at his best while working for me has always been a top notch communicator, leader, and professional. One time we had sat down to coach an employee who was not picking up a new job very well. Brandon took his time to explain that the employee could do the job if he would just slow down and think about the big picture. In a faced paced environment it is easy to get sidetracked and tricked into getting down on yourself, Brandon assured the employee to follow the standards and to simply stop and ask for help when needed. This employee has since passed the job, still gets flustered occasionally, but is overall a better employee in this position.. Brandon can take a task and run with it. In only the short amount of time that I have supervised Brandon, 6 months, he has taken many task left from the previous leader and ran away with them. An example of this is, his daily management board. When Brandon took over the department/shift he was eager to get rid of the old beat upDMS board that was left for us to use by our corporate team. In their eyes the board was working fine, but who likes to work with old beat up material / eye sores. Brandon put his own touch on the board and has since gotten many comments from the person who originally put the board up. Kudos.. When Brandon trained 2 backups for himself in the matter of weeks I was shocked. His trainees picked up most of the important topics and tasks. I have never seen leadership be trained so efficiently.. Brandon has always been a great friend, but what I find unique about him is his ability to always be there to help out his friends in times of need. I can recall many times over the years where Brandon has helped me out when no one else would. Onetime years ago I was out hunting alone many miles from the truck in some very steep country when I had shot my first deer. Not knowing much about how to field dress the deer I made a phone call to my good friend and hunting partner Steve to see if he could come help me field dress the animal and help pack the meat back up the steep mountain to the truck. Knowing the area I was in and the physically demanding work that it would take to hike out the meat, Steve was unwilling to help out. After calling Brandon, he was excited to hear I had just harvested my first deer and had no hesitation to come help me pack out my deer. Brandon arrived with his pack and a couple knives and we were able to get the deer quartered up and back to the truck before dark. Without his unselfishness and willingness to help the meat would have most likely spoiled.. Another strength of Brandon’s is his ability to keep calm in stressful and life threatening situations. Every fall, winter steelhead begin their migration into the rivers of western Oregon. One of Brandon’s favorite passions is floating the rivers in his drift boat fishing for these beautiful hard fighting fish. One year while joining Brandon on a float down the Umpqua River, Brandon’s boat got hung up on a rock just under the surface of the water. Because the water was higher than usual this year the rock was normally out of the water and easily seen. Within seconds we could all tell the boat was really stuck and the water around us was beginning to rise very quickly. Within seconds the boat would be taking on ice cold water. I and another guy sitting next to me thought for sure the boat was going to take on water and quickly sink. Frozen from fear we both just sat in our seats unsure what to do. Brandon quickly directed us both to move over to one side to level out the boat to keep the water from spilling in over the edge. He then removed his oar from the oar lock and used it to push of a rock next to the boat. With a few rocks of the boat we were unstuck from the rock and floating safely down river. Without Brandon’s clear thinking the boat would have surely taking on water and quickly filled up putting usin the frigid water to swim for our lives.. For as long as I've know Brandon (20 years) he has always been a positive guy. I'd would have to say one of his biggest strengths is his consistent positive attitude in life. No matter what the situation is he always makes the experience fun and enjoyable. From slow fishing trips on the river to a flat tire on the way to a hunting trip, he always makes lite of the situation creating laughter among friends and lifting spirits when others would normally be frustrated or feeling down.",18

I have known Max since we were children and I can attest that he has consistently been there as a friend and has been very supportive. He is someone who I have been able to trust and confide in. Since I have known Max for so long, there are many great memories that we have shared growing up as well. In these regards, he has provided the consistency of being a reliable friend. He has lived a number of years in Iowa since going to college but we have still maintained contact and I consider him a lifetime friend.. Max has been musically gifted for a very long time. I grew up performing with him for our high school’s bands (including marching band.. Band camp was something else that's for sure)! I have many fond memories with Max during these times and always noticed he would take a leadership role among the percussion section. These strengths came out during marching band events. I played French horn (mello phone for marching). I was keeping my rhythm and pace to the beat of his drum. These were good times and we were both quite talented. And often times in between our performances together we would be hanging out or chilling with the rest of the band.. We experienced a lot growing up together and there’s so much I could say about our memories. I know that he has shown a lot of flexibility and has been very helpful in times of need. We also played in the same baseball youth league and he was competitive in this league. We also ended up playing a little bit of high school baseball together. Max is a very dedicated and hard-working individual. I also noticed this shine in his academics. He was very good at math and demonstrated passion in weather and weather patterns. I remember learning a lot from him about meteorology concepts that I wasn't very familiar with. In that regard, on top of being a hard worker he is a good educator as well.. Since an early age Max has sought out jobs and experiences that are aimed at helping and working with younger or less experienced individuals. As a teenager Max worked as an umpire for the local baseball leagues. Max has a good disposition for dealing with the younger kids and the sometimes over excited parents. His method of dealing with both the kids and their parents seems to be somewhere between solid reasonableness and bemusement.. As a teen Max sought out and won the job of snow-board instructor at the local snow-boarding hill and although I did not observe him in action, I know that he progressed in the job and took on additional responsibilities of repairing the equipment and working the rental counter. This was another example of how Max has sought out jobs that teach or instruct others and how he is able to take on more responsibility and move into leadership positions.. I had the pleasure of spending time with Max one-on-one during a three-hundred-mile bicycle trip. During that trip, I got to know Max better and was pleasantly surprised by his ability to relate to someone well outside of his age group. Max shows a great ability to connect with people both older than him and with those younger than him. During the trip Max not only showed great grit and determination through the long days pedalling in the hot sun but he also showed great patience dealing with someone 35 years his senior. Through the years that I have known Max, I have never seen him complain about a tough task or act like a recalcitrant child. He has also always been courteous and respectful to others.. The thing about Max is that it’s tough to think of anything negative about him...Max is positive. Or perhaps quietly confident is more precise. With an extended family of extroverts who love to talk loud and long, Max can be depended on to allow others, even those less confident, to hog the lime light. There’s not much of a story here, rather a personality characteristic. In my memory, family gathering after family gathering, I can easily picture Max, a smile on his face, listening. It seems like a small thing, but the older I get the more I admire people who, when the opportunity arises, choose to listen rather than chime in with something that will make them “seem ""more important.. Max is creative. I’ll never forget the last time Max visited us. No one expects accountants to paint masterpieces or bankers to sing arias—and I surely never expected my weather statistics obsessed nephew to voluntarily put on a choreographed performance with flaming batons. That’s right, when Max said he had a surprise for us, flaming batons was the last thing I expected. As Max tossed and twirled those batons like a pro, we sat (safely outside) on our porch mesmerized and just a little amused. It was one of those moments where you wonder, what made him decide to take that up? It was so beautiful, so well-rehearsed and absolutely entertaining! Einstein said that “creativity is intelligence having fun.” That pretty much sums up Max.. Max is determined. As I write this last piece, I struggle with whether it’s more important that, despite little to no financial support, Max went to college – or –whether it’s more important that, despite his parent’s struggles, Max has remained a kind, loving and loyal son. Or... maybe I should just stick with the fact that his two older sisters (i.e. older sisters are the world’s toughest critics) think the world of him. I remember the summer he stayed with us for a few days. We’d had his sisters for sleepovers, but never Max, and I wasn’t sure what to expect. All I can say is that it was like having another son in the house. He fit in perfectly, golfing with us, eating our strange vegetarian diet without complaint and competing, no holds barred, inboard games and cards. Finally, and possibly most important, what these three short pieces demonstrate is that Max Rush is balanced. His outlook, his talents, his ambition...they weave together making him an asset for any group or group setting. We’re lucky to have him in our family.. I can only give you my observations of who Max is over the years. Max has grown throughout the years that I have known him. All cousins born I have witnessed, on my dad’s side of the family, and from baby to sprout to adult, I can say that I am proud to know them for they have all demonstrated the capacity to survive in these troubled times with responsibility and merit. Max is a grown up, keen in mind and sharp in intellect. He has, what I consider to be, an engineer’s mind, a mind capable of critical thought and a mind never at rest to challenge himself to new theories and ideas that would bring brilliance of colors to stagnation. New ideas give strength and Max has great potential within him to do all that is expected of him. In addition, Max has made it this far and I suspect you have noticed potential greatness in him else I would not be receiving this invitation to further prove what he has naturally within him. I believe he will make a fine addition to the career path he has chosen and it is my hope that these words will be received well by whoever decides to review them. As far as other stories go, from child to adult, I would endorse Max certainly. I have my own career as an N.M.T. (Neuro-muscular Therapist) within a practice called, Somavida Pain Relief Center in Evanston, IL and it has become a successful venture; I would never jeopardize my own career needlessly, hence these words I testify as truth or else I would not be writing this. Thank you for reading and Max, all my hopes for your success. :)Your cousin, Al. When Max graduated from College he invited my family and I to Iowa for his ceremony. He was so proud, confident, and showed great leadership skills. My husband, mother, step-father, and I all drove to watch him graduate. Max led us through the town he lived in to show us everything he had experienced during those years at Iowa State. He did great explaining historical landmarks and even gave us information about little anecdotes he learned while living there. Max showed such pride while giving those tours. During that visit his school’s Meteorology department had a breakfast for the graduates with their professors. This was just wonderful to sit back and watch the professionalism and respect Max portrayed towards his superiors. He introduced his family to his professors with such grace and was just so proud to have us there experiencing this chapter in his life coming to a close. Walking around with Max while he showed us his classrooms and gave us details about certain things he learned was so inspiring. Needless to say, that was a wonderful weekend with Max and my family. It was great to see Max in that adult capacity with so confidence and he was such a leader during that weekend.. I am Max’s oldest sister (6 years older) and have really grown to watch him become such a great young man. He is always so thoughtful and seriously can pick out the best jewellery I own. Years ago, I was probably around 21; therefore, Max was probably 15, I was out living the life in Los Angeles. I had gone through some terrible heartbreaks and my much younger but very sweet brother wanted to make me feel better. For Christmas that year, he bought me the open heart necklace (when it was first popular). It was so sweet he even paid attention to what my younger self was experiencing and just wanted to put a smile on my face. It was so thoughtful and is even to this day one of my favorite necklaces... I’m even wearing it right now as I type this. Throughout the years, he’s always been so thoughtful and has such a great eye to some really fun and beautiful jewellery that he’s gifted me since then. I think I even wear the pieces Max has gotten me more than I wear pieces my husband has bought. HA. Max is so reliable. My husband and I had just rescued a new puppy, Luna, and had an event to be at. We set up for someone to let Luna out at a certain time and feed her etc. Those plans fell through as we were already out at the event. So, in a panic I called Max and asked if he could please make time to run over to our house and just let Luna out and feed her. He said of course he can without hesitation. Not only did he feed her and let her out, he stayed for over an hour to play with her in the backyard. We appreciated him being so flexible last minute to help us out and then go above and beyond to make sure our new puppy had some play time as well.. Max the genius. I'm a real picky anal individual. So when I tell everyone that Max is a genius, I don't say this because he's my cousin. I don't say he’s a genius because I'm simply hoping for the best and will say anything to make him look good. I say he’s a genius because he really is a genius, no doubt about it. I love magnets. I have a lot of magnets in all sorts of shapes and colors. I also have this large set of magnets designed to be shaped like a complex DNA structure. This is a kind of design that is very difficult to get in the right order since it includes color. When Max stayed with me for an evening, I showed him the finished magnet DNA structure then I took it apart and bunched everything together - like messing up a puzzle. So I challenged Max to put the magnets back together to the complex DNA structure and reminded him that the structure includes the right color. Not only did he put everything back together, later that evening, he turned the  to a complex Molecule. That's when I realized he’s a true genius. Of all the guests I had at my home, he is the only one who solved the puzzle while giving me a Molecule that's beyond even me.. I held Max when he was just born. Technically, he’s the youngest cousin on my dad's side of the family. I may be only a cousin to Max but I did spend a lot of time with him as he grew up so I care for him like a baby brother. I can confidently say everyone on this planet has some sort of family issue. There's always something everyone can relate too that could make great dramatical soap operas on TV. However, one thing I realized, Max is the only cousin that I never had an argument with, the only cousin that could do no wrong. Even when times were at the worst for those closest to Max, he was always there as positive support. He may be the youngest cousin but he is a pillar for those closest to him and I’m very proud of him. It's very difficult for me to think of 3 stories simply because Max is already awesome at everything and the last 2 stories pretty much sums up the youngest cousin who became a great man. He’s great at being intuitive, he's a natural genius, and he's the perfect example of what a man should strive to be. But if I must, then I'll remind the world of the obvious. Because he's a great man, because he's a genius, he's also great at learning. Before he left to join the Air Force, he was helping his father lay tiles. Yes, this is a typical carpenter/construction type job but it does take a detailed mindset to lay tiles so it looks high quality professional work. Not only did Max learn to lay tiles, the quality of his work surpassed his fathers 30+ years of experience within a few months. To top that off, Max showed me tiles created by hand like a professional artist. Again, proving that Max is a true genius.. Max was born - cute baby. Max grew up - still cute plus loving and caring. Max along with his sister and brother-in-law were visiting me when I received an alarming text from my neighbor that Maisey (Boston Terrier) was missing. Without hesitation, Max joined us in the search for Maisey. Max even went beyond the neighborhood boundaries which concerned me because it was dark and it was a new area for him. It just goes to show the type of person he is - very caring and loving.❤️P.S. Maisey was found safe and sound.... I’ve worked with Max on several school projects, one of which he invited me to join in on. He had been working with a fellow classmate on an extracurricular project for a school club. Max was excited to get started and we used our free time to help out with designing the project. Max and I were working with two others who Max had befriended, and it ended being a great networking/learning experience. In addition, he showed an innovative and eager mindset with the project :). Max, you have always been someone that’s very easy to get along with and you're someone who’s very easy to work with, both professionally and in a friendly environment ;) Also, I’ve seen that you have a wide range of knowledge and can do well in almost any course you take. You are able to work very well with your technical skills as well as social skills, without any problem at all, so I’m sure that you're professional path will move smoothly.",21

Each time I attended the class after the initial, my interest in the subject matter became less and less until it became repetitive. Be it the instructor or the fact that I had attended the course and felt that I had learned all I needed. The last couple times you were the instructor for the course. You are a fine public speaker and you are able to engage the group.. Green Dot Staying with your ability to speak to a large number of people. Green Dot training. Another course that most people are not excited to set through. You were able toad dress the group with the material that was probably mandatory to be covered and also allow the class to move in other directions that pertained to Green Dot. Very well done.. Annual Ping Pong Tournament Who else could draw so many non ping pong players together in one place.. When Ashley met her husband, Troy, he was a single father with two young children. His relationship with his former wife, and the mother to his children, was filled with conflict. These conflicts were mostly initiated by Troy’s former wife, who made it a habit to drag the kids into the fighting, causing emotional stress and havoc for the kids. When Ashley began her relationship with Troy, she immediately embraced his children and became one of the family. Her presence in Troy’s life added a tremendous amount of calmness, stability, and compassion to his children’s lives. I witnessed this firsthand as I am their grandfather. As the step mother to these children, Ashley has made a profound and positive impact on their development and overall happiness. Her strengths include great parenting skills, compassion and understanding along with the necessary amount of discipline and leadership. She has been a terrific role model and is respected and loved by her step-children.. As an outstanding parent and role model to her step children, Ashley is the target of much criticism from the kids’ biological mother. The birth mother has had many struggles in her personal life, and has done a very poor job of parenting. She is jealous of Ashley, and is always putting Ashley down in front of the kids, which upset them greatly. Ashley came to resent these comments, not so much as the insult from their mother, but because of the damage inflicted on the kid’s emotional well-being. The mother's nasty lies and comments caused a lot of pain for the children, but their mom didn't care. She has such a need to inflate her self-worth by criticizing others, that she was unconcerned about the damage inflicted on her own kids. Ashley struggled with this, but was able to overcome her contempt of the kid's mother and tolerate all the stress she caused because she knew the value and stability that she brought to her step-children’s’ lives. Her strength is her ability to control her own feelings, and her commitment to put the needs of others before her own personal feelings. She is confident in herself and doesn’t allow petty criticism to affect her.. Ashley is very goal-oriented and embraces an attitude of constant self-improvement. One of her recent challenges was a fitness program. She rode her bicycle to work each day, despite darkness, harsh weather, and the inconvenience. When we would invite her to do something, she would always come after she finished her work-out at the gym. Her strengths are her self-discipline and commitment to constantly improve herself.. ASHLEY HAS NO CHILDREN OF HER OWN BUT MARRIED INTO A FAMILY OF TWOSTEPCHILDREN. THE FATHER HAS PRIMARY CUSTODY DUE TO POOR LIFESTYLECHOICES MADE BY THE MATERNAL MOTHER.

HER RESOLVE TO HAVE A GOOD AND LOVING HOME ATMOSPHERE ISADMIRABLE.. I have mountains of positive stories stretching over the 38 years I have had you as my sister. The mere fact that you have put up with Mom and I is a pretty miraculous accomplishment! Ashley, you are the strongest woman I know with a heart of fire and core of gold! You are smart, driven, grounded, compassionate and beautiful in both appearance and soul. I have watched you grow into an amazing woman from a little bald-headed, blue-eyed toddler curious of the world to the woman so many people admire today. Your personality is so infectious you draw others to you in an instant. I love how bald-headed you were and how syrup on a bow was the only way to attach it to your perfectly round head. You were the oldest thumb sucker I have ever known too, Lol! You are not a quiter, even at sucking your thumb you didn't let hot sauce, duct tape or ridicule stop you! Even today, you let nothing stand in your way. In high school, I remember you playing three sports: basketball, track and softball. Sports take time, dedication and talent. I remember you twisting your ankle so bad we thought I was broken. You healed and then back out there you went. Years later you tore your acl playing softball, had surgery right before Thanksgiving and you still hosted the holiday for your family. You were a little out of it, lol, but you did what most wouldn't have considering the situation. This is the strength and heart I have seen inside you from a innocent little girl wanting to make everyone happy to the woman you are today. You make the world a better place and I love you for it!. Let's talk about your passion for animals. There is nothing more giving than having kindness in ones heart for beings that only want to be loved. You have always been an advocate for animals and animal rights. It is a passion we both share. It is my belief when a human can show compassion for animals, that it mimics their true inner self. You have that sister. You have even went as far as to go or try to go vegetarian! That tells me you truly feel heartache knowing harm may come to an animal due to human consumption. I also know you would be a farm lady with lots of pets, if you could, Lol! So would I sister! You have a brilliance about you that shines greater than the sun. You are one of God's greatest gifts to both humankind and animals.. I'm not sure if I have said this before to you, hopefully I have, but you are the best gift I could ever have been given in my life. To have your love, is my security blanket. You have always had my back, even when I have hurt you and didn't deserve you. You have always been one step away when I needed you, even when it messed up your plans. You have always loved me, even when I am a wreck. You have never made me feel judged, incapable or not good enough. In fact, you comfort me at my lowest and weakest moments in life. When Skyler died I was in need and you dropped everything to be by my side. When I divorced Jeremy you dropped everything to come help me pack and move. I can never explain to you what these moments have meant to me. I feel unworthy of you and I feel like I have not shown you how much you mean to me sister. You are a support system for so many, just because of your heart. You sacrifice and give many chances to those, even some that are undeserving sometimes. Never doubt your strength. Never doubt your heart. Always hold your head high. I hope one day I can repay you for the love you have given me...for I am nothing without my sister. God sent me an angel the day you were born Ashley! I love you very much.",12

Although it was super frustrating many times during the process, you were devoted to what was truly best for him, even though it took so much time away from work and family. You were able to put aside your own beliefs about his issues and provide him with the utmost care--it was professional, non-judgmental, and very unbiased. I think it takes someone super strong to be able to overcome their own feelings about a serious issue in order to help someone out through their own dark and trying situation. While you didn't always know the answer, you were able to find the answers and guide this person as best as you could.. Another area of great strength: being a single dad and persevering through all the changes, challenges, and difficult times that come with blending a family and learning how to cope with raising a difficult child. I think you are still working on how to be able to provide what is best for the family as a whole, but it seems like you have had some revelations and are more willing to at least consider other options. That is a huge step and it takes a lot of strength to admit that you may not be the most equipped person to complete a job. It is courageous to develop new strategies at parenting, and leading people, and participating in such a diverse society in general. Having an open mind is a great strength that I don't think a lot of people truly have, and overcoming personal feelings and determining what is truly right or wrong for a ""unit"" as a whole, is even harder to achieve. It's scary to have so many changes happening at once, but you are really one of the strongest people I know; you're our protector and our rock, even when it's hard, and even when it's hard on you. Your growth in our family has translated into other aspects of your life, and I think that open-mindedness will become one of your stronger suits if it is a quality that you continue to nurture and develop.. Then, there is physical strength. You are a pillar of fitness and strength and I admire that about you. You have great self-control when it comes to what you eat (maybe not necessarily the portion sizes, but the quality of nutrients you take in). You maintain a position of power based on your physical appearance, alone. Your presence commands a room, and I know that I feel very safe when you are around and very proud that you are my protector and my mate. I haven't always had someone like that, and I am glad that you have been able to stay ""fit to fight"" in so many ways.. Ronnie is in my opinion one of the best dad's/brother out there. Since I've known him he has worked extremely hard to be where he's at in life. Whenever he sets a goal, rest assured that goal will be accomplished no matter what obstacle may come in his way. Usually along with that he will meticulously plan his approach to goals with failsafe plans built in, essentially making sure he has the full picture to anticipate any issues that may arise. This part of Ronnie has been there for the entire time I've known him. For example, his time in Tae Kwon Do when we were younger, he had a goal to get into higher levels of competitive sparring. He dedicated time to practicing daily, taking extra classes, and studying new or old techniques to better himself. This hard work and dedication has shown through his professional life and personal life of being a husband, father and brother.. One thing I love about my brother Ronnie is that he has never hesitated to reach outa helping hand for his kids, wife, family and people that are strangers to him. He does it out of the goodness of his heart and never ever asks for anything in return. He has made sacrifices in life for the betterment of his family and friends that a normal person wouldn't even think twice of doing. That is something truly hard to find in this world and he has that caring and compassion down despite what life has thrown at him. Cadet Brandtman has showed great leadership as an element leader. His initiated help giving the guide on bearer feedback has reminded me that we are a team and has taught me to do the same with others.. Cadet Brandtman is attentive during academic time and adds valuable input to the class discussion. Seeing him alert, despite how exhausted and tired we are, helps me to try and reengage the lessons presented and class discussions.. Cadet Brandtman's calm demeanor and respect for other team members shows a lot about him as a leader. Staying calm under pressure, while still treating others with respect and dignity is key to being a good leader. He sets a good example for the rest of us when we are under pressure from the staff.. Ronnie was a powerhouse in the work center. His work ethic was unparalleled; however, his most inspiring qualities were his eagerness to learn and willingness to seek feedback. His thirst for knowledge never stopped. As soon as he finished his bachelor's degree, he began working towards a master’s degree. This quest for knowledge was not restricted solely to off-duty education but was seen in the workplace as well. He was fully qualified on all the equipment and worked to ensure he knew how to be the best supervisor and NCO he could be. He constantly sought feedback and direction to ensure he was doing things to the best of his ability and to push himself to improve. He never settled, believing there was always some way to improve himself. This dedication and eagerness was an inspiration to me, driving me to make sure I was able to answer his questions or give the direction he needed.. Ronnie exemplified true leadership in the way he took care of his subordinates. He constantly pushed them to do their best and made sure they were recognized for their hard work. However, his drive to take care of our people never rang more true than when he went above and beyond to take care of one of the Airmen struggling with personal issues. He made sure he received the care he needed and stayed by his side as long as he needed. He took care of every aspect of the ordeal and was ultimately recognized by leadership for his efforts.. Ronnie is motivated and driven to get the job done. He put his all into everything he did. Unafraid of taking on a challenge, he seeks to find solutions to any problem encountered. One of his most impressive achievements occurred while we were getting ready to install new state-of-the-art radios at our facility. We needed specific test equipment in order to prepare the new radios. However, this equipment was very expensive and included way more features than were necessary. Ronnie immediately began to come up with ideas and determined that we could build the equipment we needed for a fraction of the cost. He took it upon himself to engineer and design the component we needed. Knowing that this would be a major accomplishment, he sought to include as many of the Airmen as he could so they could take credit for it as well. His ability to develop solutions or find ways to workaround problems is an aspect that will be sorely missed in the work center.. What is this, some more homework I have to deal with? Lol I’m just messing with ya. Anyways, here are my three stories about ya that highlight your unique strengths. First off, the thing that sets you apart from everyone else is how personable you are. You get along with everyone and anyone you come across. I know there were plenty of days where I was pissed off, moody, or upset about something; but you were always friendly and cool with me. And I knew I could always expect the same ol’ easygoing sergeant Brandtman. Even with the countless people you’ve worked with, you always ask to see how they are doing before taking care of work. I could go on and on about different stories that remind me of how personable you are. #Randolph. Secondly, one of your strengths is your ability to motivate others. I know we’ve been through a lot of projects that weren’t much fun, but you have that ability to motivate others; to make the situation a lot better. During the radio project specifically, you motivated 9 Junior Enlisted to keep pushing on when the situation sucked. Even when we lifted together, you were the one spotting me when I first bench 300! You were also there when I pr-ed my deadlift! Something about your motivation is contagious to others, which I consider one of your greatest strengths!#City. Lastly, your humbleness is another strength that you possess. Your athletic ability is one of the best I have ever seen. I don’t know if there is a sport out there that you can't play. And I have seen you destroy some people in basketball, volleyball, walleyball, football, you name it. But you never rub it in anyone’s face when u beat them. It goes without saying, but you are a good winner. Your humbleness even made it fun to be on the opposing team. You know when it’s okay to talk crap and when to stay quiet. You never brag or boast about how great you are something. #Ballers. Ronald Brandtman is a man who appears to be versatile with his personal and professional background he brings to the team. He is patient and understanding of the needs of his peers and is always willing to lend a hand. The demeanor and mannerisms by which he abides are courteous and polite. His language is never poor in taste and he is not afraid to take the lead on any new task. He volunteered onetime to assist me going to my car in the hot Alabama heat and carry some of my belongings. Without his efforts, I would have had to make multiple trips and returned exhausted. He is definitely a team player.. Mr. Brandtman continued to astound me with his behavior as he maintains a sense of positivity. Every time I see him, he's running a mile a minute but I can tell he is prioritizing his responsibilities from the array of roles he has. His poise and attitude shows everyone that he wants to be here and it can provide a sense ease amongst his fellow cadets. With a quick joke, other can almost forget where they are and enjoy the simple things in life.. Being tall and broad already can make someone stand out from the crowd, but recognizing it as a strength and leading those who follow is a courageous act not many can achieve. It calls for the individual to stand in the limelight where judgement is present and knowledge is key to person's success. But every time, Brandtman takes the forefront without hesitation and will lead by example.. Ronnie was the new guy in our shop in Cannon at the time, only there for maybe a month. My friend I was living with at the time was moving and I needed to find a place to stay. I was still fairly new to ""real life"" so this friend had offered for me to stay with him to get out of the dorms, so with him moving out, I would have to find a place to live on my own for the first time in my life and I was scared. While playing some online games with a couple guys in the shop, Ronnie included, he said ""if you guys ever want to come over, I have this big house and it's just Kade and I"" so I thought on it for a while and decided to see if he'd let me stay with him. Ronnie didn't even hesitate. I needed a place to live and he saw that and let me into his home and to this day he's one of the greatest and closest friends I have, and I consider myself lucky to have a friend like that in my life.. Ronnie got divorced and his ex wife didn't even show up to the court hearing to decide who got his son Kade. The judge was still trying to rule in the mothers favor. He fought hard for his son and won in the end. I was lucky to have lived with him the years I did and as I never had a real father figure, I learned everything I knew about being a dad from Ronnie. Now I have a daughter and another on the way and my wife and kid say I'm the best dad they've ever seen but I owe it all to Ronnie.. I started lifting weights with Ronnie, or as he would frequently say ""BIG TRON."" After all the hard work with him, I was going for a new personal best of deadlifting 380 lbs, I loaded up the bar and walked into the house to get a bottle of water. When I came back he was sliding more plates on the bar and I asked ""what is that at now?"" and all he replied with was ""you know!"" He added more to make it an even 400 lbs. a goal I'd talked about for a long time. Ronnie pushed me beyond anything I ever thought I could do and taught me that no matter what I'm up against, with willpower and good people behind me I can prevail. I lifted that 400 lbs. I never would have unless I had Ronnie to push me and guide me along the way.. Cadet Brandtman is a lighthearted, fun-loving, encouraging guy. I have seen him at his best when he has clear direction and he is self-driven to complete whatever he's doing to the best of his ability. He strives for perfection with his finance and mail assignments.. Cadet Brandtman has shown leadership and a desire for excellence in drill. He is regularly the first element leader and ensures that those behind him have a fantastic example to follow. He complies with each command as issued to the best of his ability. He offers valuable tips to others but does not take command away from the present flight leader. His focus is on the betterment of the entire flight and not just himself.. When Cadet Brandtman is at his best he is smiling and making everyone else smile. He lightens the mood, sometimes at his own expense, and makes everyone feel better. He has developed a more enjoyable version of the squadron chant and it helps our flight move past low morale points. Lightening the mood is probably one of his unique strengths and he is not hesitant to use this strength for everyone's benefit.",23

He also knows the timing of using his position power. He won the trust from his fellow members.. I hadn’t known Mike for too long before realizing he is a great friend and 100%dedicated to caring about and being there for each individual in his life. I have never known Mike to turn down a conversation or chance to spend time together. He always makes time for people who are important to him, and he always makes one feel important. I have numerous examples of when Mike made time for our friendship during college while he was juggling classes and leadership responsibilities. But perhaps a better example was when Mike, while working full time at Moffet in the bay area (San Jose), made time to come visit my wife and I as we were driving through the area a few hours away in Sacramento. He showed up at a random Panera at a random time of the day in order to catch up and meet my newborn daughter and son. We hadn’t seen each other in months and it had been years since we were roommates at college. Still, being Best Man at my wedding and my best friend in college, Mike takes our friendship seriously and never misses a chance to catch up, even if it means spending his scarce free time to drive 4-plus hours round-trip to hang out at a Panera for a couple of hours. And I knew it meant a lot to him because he told me that it did, and he never made a fuss about the inconvenience. That's classic Michael Steven DeWein.. Mike brings high-quality character and ambition to each organization he is a part of. Even though Mike has fears and insecurities like the rest of us, his positive attributes over shine all of that because Mike is an overcomer. One example of this attribute is when Mike stepped into a leadership role in college. I was head of the student government and Mike headed up the weekly chapel service as a student coordinator. Not only did he schedule and communicate directly with nationally-known speakers, but in that capacity Mike was responsible for making announcements and other presentations to the entire student body at these twice-weekly events. I know Mike had a hard time with public speaking because we talked about it extensively, yet he willingly stepped out of his comfort zone knowing he would learn and grow through the experience. By the end of that year he was comfortable being a regular speaker in front of hundreds of students and faculty members, and he had developed a reputation in his role that served our school well. He is a great representative of organizations and causes, and I have no doubt that when Mike takes on roles or challenges that stretch his boundaries and current skill set, he will learn and overcome and in the end he and his organization will benefit from his courage and fortitude.. I’ve ever known anyone as dedicated and dependable as Mike. Because of his dedication, Mike brings a level of vitality and intensity to everything he does. I've been a witness to Mike’s development in the military, from beginning his courses in aircraft maintenance to becoming an expert in his current position. Mike always shows a drive to learn and succeed in every job. He takes every task as a challenge to learn something new. His appetite for developing his skill is insatiable. I remember Mike telling me about his first job working on helicopters, and how he was mastering the mechanics of flight – above and beyond his job description. Wanting to be a pilot from the beginning, Mike wasn’t satisfied merely passing classes and obtaining certifications. He wants to be the best at his craft, and accordingly he takes every step necessary along the way to separate himself from the pack, establish his credentials and prove that he has drive and the will to succeed. Mike has the biggest heart, and he puts it into action every day. There is no mistaking that he is exceedingly caring and will do the best job he can no matter how big or small the task.. Perseverance When Michael came back from deployment, he had only two months to prep for a trip with my friends and I to Mt. Whitney in late spring. During that time of the season, Mt. Whitney is a difficult challenge that requires the party to be in top shape and knowledge of snow climbing. He knew that this was a very important trip for me and my big brother, so naturally he wanted to be there to support me and my dream. Even though Mike did not have enough time to prepare he would practice going hiking and training at the gym. Fast forward, the trip to Mt Whitney was in late April 2017 was the most exciting adventure and mountaineering trip, and more than we could have hoped for. Was it tough trucking through snow? Of course with a 50lb ruck and lugging your items to the highest summit in California. I would say that wasn't easy. As we further walked up that mountain, I started getting affected by the altitude and Mike also was getting tired, but he hid it from me. He wanted me to keep on pushing, and he was the one being the strongest for us. Mike, is a guy who won't complain when something is hard. He will always keep pushing for others to feel safe. And that is what he did for me. We made it base camp at 12,400ft of elevation. We were not able to summit the following day because I was still feeling the altitude, but Mike stayed with me. Even if his teammate is not at their best, he will always elevate his team with his stress management skills and ability to think through problems.. Willingness to adapt and try new things Mike used to be a picky eater when we first started dating. He was not willing to try new things because he did not grow up being open minded. Hailing from Vietnam, in my culture we eat a lot of seafood, chicken, pork, and beef. Seafood and fish sauce is what throws him off because we use fish sauce in a majority of our food stock for seasoning. Anytime, we went out or if my mom made something. I would tell him hey just eat it and don't ask questions. He was afraid to try new things, but I said hey if you want to date me. You have to accept my heritage and my food. So, it took him awhile to adjust to seafood and fish sauce. His weakness is learning how to adjust to a different lifestyle either it is food or my culture, but he learned to understand and adapt.. Commitment to Family Mike and my dad have spent nights re-doing the pipes in my parent's house. No matter how tired Mike was, he wanted to help my dad. I remember, they would work all the way until 2 pm and Mike only had two hours before of sleep before his shift. But somehow he would roll out of bed and keep moving no matter how tired. Mike was willing to put family first and suffer some of the lack of sleep while he worked as an aircraft mechanic on base.. DeWein has basically become a mentor for others and is capable of helping boost their strengths with constructive criticism. His process allows for individuals to gain understanding and reason behind his recommendations.. He displays control in stressful situations and uses the best practices when problem solving to find the best solutions. DeWein can articulate well, and has almost a professional quality when presenting information to a large audience.. DeWein is a humble person who enjoys challenges and pushing his limits. He believes in strengthening his weakness to be a well-rounded force to be reckoned with.",10

One of which was the development of a robust and lightweight Aluminum Airfield Matting. The matting was intended to modernize and replace the outdated Vietnam Era matting; it’s important to highlight the mattings primary function is to provide a Foreign Object Debris (FOD) Cover which is placed overtop of temporarily repaired craters caused by high ordinances, bombs, missiles, mortars, etc. caused from the impact of explosives during wartime scenarios. This was one of Julie’s first projects and she was impressive from the start. She assigned teams according to skill levels/abilities, established daily schedules, sought out and garnered specialized contracts, and always met or exceeded suspense dates and met every milestone. She led and organized high visible demonstration events with many of the attendees being at the Congressional, Senate, and Military General Staff levels. Her efforts and success was instrumental and flawless, which lead her, the team, and the project towards a successful outcome.. The stories I have about Julie’s successes in leadership and management are numerous. Whether she was in charge of the project or the assistant Engineer she took the tasking seriously and never appeared to falter. She led many of the efforts of creating a mobile airfield rubber removal machine (titled as the transformer), and she helped design and modify a mobile asphalt batch plant which produce continuous (non-stop) batches of ready to place hot-mix asphalt. She was a key player in an airfield specific asphalt mix designed specifically to handle the wheel weights of various joint service aircrafts, and she oversaw several aspects of 20aircraft tie-down anchors for asphalt and Portland cement pavements designed to handle hurricane force winds. Julie’s accomplishments are numerous and she excelled at every aspect. Since meeting her, I can recall numerous times standing in awe at her achievements and ability to, not just meet the objective but, lead others. I genuinely look forward to seeing the great things she does and the accomplishments she makes during her career in the AF!. One of my fondest memories of Julie is her uncanny ability to focus on team morale and genuine care towards everyone, regardless of their defined roles, position, and/or level of responsibility. She took care to emphasize and, when needed, correct negative behavioral patterns. She demonstrated superb leadership skills as she continuously inspired followers, at all levels, to consistently reach seemingly unachievable benchmarks; epitomizing nothing was impossible. During my time working with Julie she proved to be invaluable, she provided guidance and support to those that lacked technical skills and ensured those that excelled were recognized for it. As a retired AF MSgt, I was inspired and immediately recognized Julie’s out of the ordinary leadership abilities; that’s the fundamental reason I was one of the first, if not the first, to approach her about pursuing a life in the Air Force. I knew from the moment I started working with her that she would be an invaluable asset. I have no doubt that she will one day be recognized as a leader of all leaders, and a patriot who helped guide our nation into a better place, a place known for peace and democracy.. Mentor-ship - During the July – August 2016 time-frame an Air Force Academy Cadet was assigned to the Air Force Civil Engineer Support Center (AFCEC) Research Laboratory to gain practical civil engineering experience by working a project with an experienced engineer. Julie was working an ongoing Improved Backfill Project that pertained to improving the strength characteristics of soils requiring minimal compactive effort and time. Julie put together a research plan to investigate the percolation characteristics of multiple aggregate types. She designed a test matrix, wrote a test plan, and provided mentor-ship to the cadet to help him understand the importance of the research and how to properly conduct research. Julie not only mentored the cadet on a professional level, she struck a perfect balance of research mentor-ship and one-on-one personal exchanges that allowed her to gain trust and respect from the cadet. At the end of the effort Julie had shown all that she was extremely well versed in fostering long term and trusting working relationships with what would have otherwise been considered a complete stranger just a few weeks prior.. Teamwork – Julie left a legacy behind when she left the Research Laboratory of teambuilding by working in the trenches with her co-workers. Julie was always the first to show for work and the first to begin the work day full speed. Julie expected a lot from her teammates in all aspects. She expected everyone to be on time, to work hard, and to work meticulously. Not only did she expect these things from her teammates, she led the team by example. Anyone that was working with Julie always knew that she was going to work as long as it took to get the job done properly and also provide a high quality end product. They knew she would not settle for just “OK”, she wanted everything done correctly while maintaining very high standards. The important part of all of this is, Julie worked harder than anyone else on the team and was willing to do any task herself that she asked someone else to do for her. Julie’s role of leading by example made her one of the most respected individuals in our organization. Everyone knew that she was going to work hard and long hours and became highly respected for that extremely strong work ethic.. Leadership – Julie led a research effort that took her and a team of five male counterparts to Connecticut in February of 2017. The hours worked on this project were long (typically 12 – 14 hours a day/night in sub-freezing temperatures), but that was just the hours worked in the field. In order to be prepared for field work each day Julie would begin her day 2 – 3 hours before the rest of the team and would work an additional 1 -2 hours at the end of each day after her team had returned to the hotel. As her supervisor I made the trip to Connecticut for a few days to check on project and assist in any way that I could. Upon arriving in Connecticut I discovered that Julie was dealing with a team of men that were trying her patience, at best. In true “Julie Fashion” she had been attempting to lead by example, working hard, and not complaining. But, this was proving to fall short of the mark when it came to having the team work harmoniously together. Julie asked if she could speak with me privately to discuss the dilemma. Julie never complained or was critical of her team as a whole, she simply stated the facts as they were. She told me that she would like to get the group together at the beginning of the next work day and have a talk with them about expectations and behavior. I agreed that the talk should take place and that I would be happy to have that talk with the team. But, she told me she would like to handle it herself. So, even though, I was more than happy to intervene, Julie took the bull by the horns the next night. What I witnessed that night was a cool, calm, and collected professional that used all of the right words to convey her feelings about the team’s performance. She laid everything out very concisely and offered options if the team could not get their act together. I am usually one to want to add my own words to a situation like this, but when Julie was done I realized that it could not have been stated any better. So, I had nothing to add. Within a few hours the team seemed like a completely different group of guys just from the talk that Julie gave them. It was at this point that I realized Julie didn’t need my help, she had all of the tools to handle any situation that gets thrown at her.. When Julie’s work location moved from the downtown office to the research location on Tyndall AFB she didn’t hesitate to dive into the field work. There are several testing techniques to evaluate the strength of soil, each has its strengths and weaknesses. Julie discovered that there was a virtually new lightweight deflectometer(LWD) available, but not being used by engineers and technicians in the group. The LWD  is generally considered a superior testing method for measuring the strength of compacted backfill. Nobody in the group knew how to use the LWD, so Julie fixed that in a hurry. She took the initiative to learn how to use the LWD, reading manuals, talking to manufacturer reps and using it in the field. Julie didn’t stop there, she taught others how to use it. Now the LWD is used for just about every runway crater repair research project. Julie’s initiative to learn the LWD significantly improved the applied science for this work.. Teammates on successful teams support each other and learn from each other regardless of education and job experience. Julie’s backfill project was a successful team because she valued the technicians’ input and incorporated it into her project plan. She earned their respect not just because she was working side by side in the heat and dirt to test the various backfill methods but because everyone’s opinion was encouraged and heard by Julie as the Project Engineer. Good ideas were implemented, no matter who came up with the suggestion and Julie was quick to give credit to her teammates and celebrate team accomplishments.. Julie plans her work and works her plan. This approach was very evident on her inclement weather project. The impressive part was her quickness to alter the plan based on testing results, weather or logistics. The project involved working nights in Florida to gather temperature loss data in preparation for asphalt production and storage testing in Connecticut winter conditions. Julie adapted work shift hours in Florida and Connecticut based on the test data and weather forecasts, while keeping the technician overtime to the agreed to limits. This often required additional planning, instrumentation preparation and/or lab testing hours for Julie outside the team work schedule. Extra effort and Julie go together like peas and carrots.. Our Uncle Denis was a car enthusiast. He love old cars and especially had a soft spot for Corvettes. Of his several Corvettes, he has a baby blue one....maybe early 90’smodel. One night he was traveling home from our grandparent’s house and he hit as lick spot and proceeded to flip this corvette. In the end he broke his back, not to the extent that he was paralyzed but nonetheless he broke it. Now, the issue here is that Denis lived in Harriman. He was being treated at UT Hospital and his physical therapy was to be in Knoxville as well. Given that we live right outside of Knoxville (Powell)Julie took it upon herself to offer Denis her room as he could then stay at our house and be closer to his doctors/physical therapist. She showed such selflessness by giving up her comforts for him. Honestly, this wasn’t a surprise to me....this is just Julie.. Our father has been fighting cancer since the mid-90s. Over the last 10 or so years, he and our mom takes a trip (or 2) to Mayo clinic in MN. There was one specific year that things were a little more tense than they previous had been with our dads situation. During this time Julie was at the University of Kentucky and she took it upon herself to take a semester away from KY to attend a local junior college in order to be able to help them out at home. This primarily was to allow her to be able to attend one of these trip to Mayo and help with all the planning that goes into it. She provided a calming perspective and presence. She provided confidence for my parents when they needed it the most.. For the last several years, Julie has taken it upon herself to ensure that her grandmother is present for all family events. Over the last several years, her grandfather passed away as well as her uncle who would drive them to family events. They live 45 minutes away. Unfortunately her grandmother is no longer able to make the trip on her own so Julie takes it upon herself, with no one asking for it, to leave the morning of (or night before) to travel down to Harriman. That way she can bring her grandmother to the family event. Once the event is over, Julie then drives her back home. This is just another example of Julie putting others before herself as well as it shows her leadership.. When I found out that Julie was going into the Air Force, I was honestly thrown back a little. I thought, “oh my goodness, I could never do that”. Just the thought scares me to death! But you see, Julie is strong. She is the strongest willed person I know. She never shows fear or ever allows for things to slow her down. She possesses so much determination and heart. Because of who she is and how she is made, I began to see that no matter the situation – she will overcome it. Her strong will to succeed will push her threw any and all obstacles. I’m proud of Julie and I’m proud that she is my sister-in-law. She is a great example for my kids.. While working out of town with a subset group of our technicians for 3 weeks, Julie noticed that one individual had made himself a source of aggravation and ridicule. She tried to reconcile the individual to the group multiple times with no success. When our boss came to check on our progress, she broached the subject with him and laid out her plan to deal with all involved. She held a meeting in which tempers could have flared and words could have been said that would have imperilled the success of our project. She handled herself and the meeting with such professionalism, confidence and tact. Had she not, the project would have been a complete failure.. Julie can be very stubborn and persistent once she determines to get something accomplished. One of the first projects that I worked on with Julie was on some testing that was performed at Edwards AFB, California. This was a project that had a client that was very awry and very much set in his ways. He was very knowledgeable, but very rough around the edges. Not know much about Julie at the time, I was not sure how she was going to take being around this client. One of the largest hurdles in the project was actually getting live flight video to help determine if the research would work or not. The client directed us to a team at Edwards AFB, and Julie spent a lot of her time developing the research and the connections to be able to get us the live flight video that we needed. The awry client was very impressed with Julie and her work, and to my knowledge still call on her for advice from time to time.. Julie has a very strong character and her compass is always pointed in the right direction. Julie grew up in Kentucky but went to the University of Tennessee. I am still not sure how someone from Kentucky ends up becoming a UT Volunteer, but that probably just me. Julie has an upbringing that will suit her for the rest of her life. She was brought up to live off the land and love this country. As a parent of two small kids, I can only hope that my kids get that understand and learn that life lesson. One story exemplifies this character is when she was performing research in Connecticut. The goal of the research was to perform a series of tests in cold weather conditions. Julie was in charge of the research and in charge of the team that went on the trip. When they first arrived, the conditions were ideal for the research and Julie gathered as much data as possible. As the trip went on, the weather was not co-operating and was not as cold as desired. So Julie had everyone switch to nights to gather the data needed. There was a lot of discussion coming from the team on some of the decisions being made. So, Julie being the strong character she is, decided to get everyone together and lay everything on the table up for discussion. After that meeting, the team performed admirably and a lot of great data was collected. Hence, making lemonade from lemons.. One of the first times I saw Julie’s leadership ability is when we had a visit from Air Force Academy Cadet Peloquin. We were provided little warning that he was coming and did not know how long he would be with us. Julie was working on an interesting research topic and stated that she could use some assistance getting some laboratory work accomplished. So, Cadet Peloquin was assigned to Julie for the duration of his stay. During that time, Julie had to bring the AFA Cadet up to speed on the research topic, teach him how perform laboratory testing, and help develop anew method for testing materials. The result was one of the best presentations given by the AFA Cadet on a new test that Julie was instrumental in helping develop. The understanding was that the test develop was so unique that the Cadet continued to develop the testing for future research at the Air Force Academy. It was Julie's leadership ability that lead the Cadet into developing a unique test to help characterize the materials that will benefit the warfighter.. I have known Julie for at least ten years. She has always been a hard worker and very motivated. She takes her work very seriously and is a go-getter in every sense of the word. During her time in graduate school, both she and I were working towards a master's degree while doing research for our theses. We would both show up at the same time in the morning, usually before 8AM and would not leave campus before 6PM. If I remember correctly, Julie’s research was to determine how terrorism blasts could damage critical infrastructure in US waterways. It was a very informative project and one that she took very seriously. Julie worked very hard on her research and our advisor was so impressed that he submitted her findings to an international conference in Tokyo, Japan. Her work was accepted and she got to present in Tokyo in front of many professors, engineers, and scientists. It is this hard work and go-getter attitude that makes Julie a great employee and friend.. Julie and I have been friends since we met in college many years ago. We first became friends when Julie and I had some of the same classes together and would study together and complete homework. We continued this friendship into graduate school. When they time came for graduation, I headed west and Julie headed south. I have lost touch with many of my friends that I went to high school and college with, but Julie and I have remained friends throughout the years. No matter how much time passes, I can pick up the phone and call her and pick right back up where we left off. She has always been a great friend, always keeping me up to date with her life and what is going on in her world. When I was studying for a certification exam for my job, she would help me on the phone at night with math problems and sent me tons of study material! I know for a fact there is no way I would have passed without her help. She has always been a great friend and I could pick up the phone at any time of the day and call or text and she would help me with whatever I need. We still meet each other as often as we can in person, even if it is only every couple of years. I know that many miles may come in between me and Julie’s friendship, but I know that no matter what life throws at both of us, we will continue to be friends for a longtime.. Julie is a very caring person and cares about every friend and family member that she comes in contact with. I know that she loves her family and would do anything for any one of them, no matter the concern. Julie does not have any children of her own, but she does have numerous nieces and nephews that she loves like her own. Every time I talk to her, she tells me about her family and how they are doing. I know that she loves it when they get to come and visit her. Her father is a cancer survivor and she has always done anything she can for her parents to show them how much she cares for them. She continues to go to doctor appointments with her dad for support, and takes her mom on special trips just so they can have some one on onetime. While we were in school, I had a medical emergency and Julie took all of my notes for me and helped me with my homework until I was back on my feet. I feel truly blessed to have someone like Julie to call my friend.. Julie is at her best when she is collaborating on a project. When developing a hand tool to be used by United States Air Force power production technicians she strove to come up with a simple tool that could be easily replicated. I liked her practical approach of trying to simplify testing procedures to ensure our technicians could easily understand the testing procedure and easily perform the testing to standardize it. When so many researchers today want to complicate things she strives to keep things simple which is refreshing!!. Julie is at her best when she is interacting with others and helping them learn. Julie took the time to explain to me the detailed research she did on aircraft arresting system tail hook skip at Edwards AFB. Her easy going attitude is a pleasure to work and interact with. She truly cared about her work and educating others (especially me). I think she will continue to mentor others as well.. Julie is at her best when working on a problem. She is very meticulous and hardworking. I appreciated it when she figured out a work around on how to use some different movie file types from F-22 aircraft arresting system testing so they could be easily watched in standard Microsoft software. I really appreciate her can-do attitude and positive outlook on life.. Julie embodies the wingman spirit, putting service before self, going out of her way to help others. I received two calls from students of a local high school and a recent college graduate that were interested in joining the military and needed advice on the process. I immediately contacted Julie and asked if she could take time out her schedule to mentor these two young men. Despite having to working late on her course work and testing for AFCEC she was able to help them. One has since joint the US Navy and the other has submitted an application for OTS to the Air Force officer selection board.. In 2013 Julie sought advice from several former military officers and enlisted personnel to develop a roadmap of preparation for a career as an officer in the USAF. She took all of the inputs to heart, developing and implementing a personal improvement program to prepare for the challenges of a life time of service. She made great strides in physical conditioning, developing communication skills and testing her leadership mettle, all while excelling at her job, performing research for the USAF, and working on a Master’s degree. In the middle of her journey, the contract on which she was working, ended without a replacement but she maintained her core purpose in the face of this set back of several months without a contract. She managed her fears as she moved from project engineer to project lead engineer using each project as an opportunity to practice her skills and test her mettle. It has been said that “Grit” is characterized by an ability to manage fear, working tirelessly to do a good job and complete the task at hand (conscientious, achievement oriented), an ability to follow through (practice for a purpose), an ability to maintain core purpose and integrity in the face of unforeseen adversity, and striving for excellence. Aristotle believed tenacity is one of our most valued virtues. Recent studies by Duckworth indicate that “Grit” (tenacity, determination, or perseverance)is one of the most important predictor of exceptional performance or success. Julie's selection for OTS, advancement to project lead and publications are a testament to her “Grit”. I predict she will be exceptional in her life’s pursuits.. The goal of a leader is not to clone herself, but to harness individual strengths for the greater good of the organization. Julie has gone from intern to lead project engineer in a few short years and authored several publications. Julie led by coordinating, integrating, and orchestrating a complex ballet of dozens of diverse, opinionated, type “A” technicians, engineers and contractors to meet customer timelines and technical requirements. Her leadership of the ADR backfill improvement study has reduced stabilized backfill logistic requirements by more than 50%. Her work on the determination of aircraft hook skip potential due to pavement roughness near the aircraft arresting systems is our primary source of information when determining the probability of hook skid while evaluating arresting systems. Her research teams have become known for their innovation in developing creative solutions. It is said that when a leader develops the skill to convert conflict into creative tension, they have found the secret to developing high performance teams. Seasoned leaders see individual differences as fuel for development, not as barriers to success. I believe Julie has become a seasoned leader and has found the secret to creating a high performance team.. Julie, working with you all these years has been an experience that will never be forgotten. From our first trip together at Camp Shelby to getting called to the pad to move the crane. You had always been a person of few words but never a wasted word. Every morning was our typical exchange of “Julie” returned with “Rob”. Even though all the other classic morning greeting pleasantries weren’t spoken out loud, it seemed that volumes were spoken with just one word. I look forward to keeping up with your career progression in the Air Force and maybe from time to time I will send you a quick “Julie” greeting.. The legendary ability of Julie Heiser to strike fear in the Pavements Group will always be remembered. You would just walk by the techs office at 0701 and everyone was up and headed following behind, with all the accompanying banter with it. Things like ""better get to the pad before Julie picks you up and throws you out there” or “don't mess with Julie, you will be sorry”. You would always wonder where all these stories would come from, because you never were an abrupt person. Everyone knows you are a no-nonsense person, but never a hard task master. But I guess this is how legends are started.. Julie, I am still amazed with you stepping outside your comfort zone here and joining the Air Force. You told me that it was something you always wanted to do and didn't want to have a regret that you didn’t even try. This is the can do spirit that the Air Force needs. In the end we only regret the chances we didn’t take.. A couple years ago there was a desire by many members of Julie’s family to do a family cookbook. Julie didn’t hesitate in leading this effort. Not only did she lead the effort to collect and design the cookbook but she also added extra features to it. These features included a genealogy in which Julie spent much time researching the family history and in the end built a family tree contained within the cookbook. She uncovered many old pictures of relatives and added these to the cookbook. So, in the end she could have just requested recipes from family members and executed this cookbook in its simplest form but she took it to another level. This is a great example of who Julie is, she doesn’t settle. When she puts her mind onto something she gives her all and more to accomplish it without failing.. This past summer, Julie was out mowing her yard and as she looked up she saw her neighbor walking out of her home on a walker. Julie had heard that she recently lost her husband and without a second thought, she stopped her mower and walked over to this elderly woman. She struck up a conversation with her and found out that she was in need to get her garbage put out for the daily pick up. Julie told the woman that she would take care of it and proceeded to gather the woman’s garbage and place it in the garbage can by the road. This shows the sweet spirit within Julie, always putting other before herself.. Julie would come and watch her niece and nephew play ball this spring and since she lives out of state, she'd always bring them snacks and treats to the game. Thinking about the other children, she'd always bring enough for the whole team. All the kids quickly loved for ""Aunt"" Julie to come to a game. Julie always shows kindness and thoughtfulness in any situation.. Several years ago Julie's great uncle passed away. The situation is a little unique as he lived in Germany. Julie’s grandmother is 100% German. She meet Julie's grandfather after WW2 in which she followed him to the US while all of her family remained in Germany. When Julies uncle passed away, her grandmother was not able to go and to be honest her mom really wasn’t in the greatest shape to go either. So, Julie took it upon herself to organize and coordinate the whole trip. She accompanied her mother as they flew to Germany and managed the family’s affairs. Julie is such a strong willed, dependable and independent person. She needs very little direction as she always takes the time to do the appropriate analytics in order to gain the necessary knowledge for each situation. Something else to note about this trip, Julie is very caring and loyal person especially to family and friends, during this trip she missed the birth of her niece Caroline.. A couple months ago Julie went on a business trip to Connecticut, where she was over a group of workers performing a job. Julie knew these workers as they have worked together previously. The job started off bad with a couple of the workers showing up late and with bad attitudes. It progressed to the point in which they were basically bullying another worker. Julie was the only female on this job site and she was the boss. She viewed the workers performance, or lack thereof, as a reflection of her and the company they all work for. To Julie, this performance was unacceptable and knowing Julie as well as I do, she wasn’t going to put up with it. She proceeded to call a meeting the next morning to address the performance gaps. By this time, her boss has come up to CT to check in. The important part to notice here is that he didn't have to do anything....Julie took ownership and addressed the performance of the workers. She was stern but respectful. In the end the performance improved, the job was completed and they came home. This is what I would consider a good skillset for leadership. From my experience of knowing Julie, There is never any doubts about Julie, she will always do what she believes is the right thing. She is fearless and not afraid to stand for what is right.",34

This course had a designated periods after lunch on Mondays and Wednesdays that were 3 and 2 hours long, respectively. Throughout our last semester, the air conditioner in our department was broken. So, we were tired after lunch, and sweating in a window-less room. Now, these are not meant to be complaints, but anyone can grow weary and fail feel the urgency to use every available minute to work. The point is that on days when we didn't have lecture for this class, not many people would turn down a legitimate excuse to NOT go up there and sweat in that uniform. Although we complain of no misery, we do look back and see that this worked out as a test of our focus. Some weeks would go by with nothing due, and the spirit among not only our group but also our whole class was easily damped down by a deceptive lack of urgency. I will say that among our group, Dan fought against this laziness the most. On one or two particular occasions, Dan was sick and on bedrest. He let us know, but came to class to touch base with the group. I could tell he felt like crap, but saw him keep focused. He didn't stay for long, but went back to his roomed and kept working on code for the project for a good bit longer than even the required period (from which he was excused to start with). This may not be extraordinary, but having worked with Dan, it is an accurate illustration of his work ethic.. This is another story about senior design. In this course, we're given ample time to complete our project with ease. Unfortunately, most college student save everything for the last few days. I'd say that our group was in the middle. We saved a lot of little things until the end. Our final presentation and demonstration was on a Monday, soon the weekend leading up to it, we spent time finishing things up, including the robot and the presentation. Two of our guys were gone for the weekend. And one guy just didn't really want to spend his weekend in Grimsley Hall. So it was me and Dan. I will confess, Dan spent a good bit more time than I did. Provided, I did not know that he had been there long before we had planned to start Saturday. But we put our brains together for half of each day and, literally, half of each night, figuring this thing out. And despite the fact that we felt at times as if we had already lost, we got the thing to work. I'm much more introverted than Dan - in fact, I would call him extroverted rather than introverted. He would have been up there whether I was there or not, doing this project, spending one of his last weekends by himself for the sake of the team. This too, I believe, is an accurate illustration of Dan's integrity.. I struggle to remember many specific instances involving very many people at The Citadel due to my poor sleepy schedule. One can make many friends at The Citadel and, although they may not be able to spend much time together (so as to capture a particular memory that stand out), they still come to know one another's character and become close. This is my case with Dan. This is more of a pattern rather than a particular story. Dan was always the most willing to speak up during lecture. Most people would stare at the board in silence for most of the lecture. Dan was willing to make comments when the class was prompted by the professor, to keep the class going and to keep the spirit in the classroom relaxed rather than tense. Even if he knew what he was saying was wrong, for the sake of keeping the lecture going - especially if it was a morning when everybody was worn out - I would say I do not remember a time when Dan was not the first to speak up if nobody else would.. Daniel the strength that I will note first is your amazing poise and ability to communicate with a wide variety of people with respect and compassion. In one example of this strength I remember coming on you talking to an elderly couple after one of your North Carolina Boys’ Choir concerts. You were probably only eleven or twelve years old, but as I stood an observed your conversation with them I was so impressed , you were at ease and you seemed to make them at ease too. You introduced yourself, answered their questions, asked them if they enjoyed the concert and then diplomatically excused yourself. You didn’t rush, you gave them your full attention and you made them feel important. It took just a few minutes of your time but your skill at connecting with others and communicating respectfully was truly impressive.. Daniel, during your sophomore and junior year in High School you performed in two different musicals. These performances represent the second of your strengths that I would like to highlight. You displayed such determination and dedication to do your best in these performances. You worked long hours after school and over the weekends learning your lines, the music and songs and even the dance routines. You worked diligently to master your own performances. In addition you worked with your fellow cast mates towards achieving a group goal producing two wonderful musical performances. Your strength of character to pursue and work determinedly for a difficult goal is inspiring.. Daniel your completion of your Knob year at The Citadel demonstrates your strengths of perseverance and determination. There are many stories I could tell to demonstrate this strength but I will always remember the day we were called to tell us you had slipped on the barracks stairs and sliced your leg open to the bone. Just arriving at The Citadel and already having a major injury you could have decided then and there it wasn’t the right college program for you. You could have left without a look back but you toughed it out. You hobbled around on crutches. You even tried to work around your injury and in fact reopened your cut doing push-ups. You then suffered a setback when the nursing staff worried that it was infected. Through it all you showed determination and perseverance. I know I would have given up but you didn’t and I saw this grit and strength again and again throughout your Knob year and even in the rest of your tenure at The Citadel all the way till graduation.. Dan exhibits a great degree of optimism. Dan selected me as a person to write complementary essays for him. From what I can tell, he is the only one who will see them and rather than constructive criticism the stories are intended to be totally positive. To think that I would do that is hugely optimistic. Love you Dan.. Dan exhibits strong commitment to his decisions. There were many times during Dan's journey through the Citadel that he could have changed paths. There were plenty of easy alternatives which he could have chosen, but instead he stuck it out and was rewarded.. Dan is a savvy consumer. From weight vests to rice cookers to cars, Dan is great at analyzing what he wants then selecting the best thing for his purpose. I often make the mistake of trying to make do with a cheaper alternative and suffer for it in the long run. I am always impressed with Dan's taste and he reigns supreme if we ever need a recommendation for a place to eat.",9

Even if he had a student struggling, he would remain patient and continue to help the student until they achieved satisfactory performance.. In the time that I have known Matt, he has always led a life with high moral character. When faced with tough decisions, you could always count on Matt to choose the right thing. As a leader this is important and I know Matt will be a good example of this to those around him.. Matt’s leadership showed in academics at UND, always striving to be the best that he could be. His desire to be the best led him to finishing at the top of his class. This will benefit him moving forward, as I know he will continue to strive for excellence.. When you started flag football, you began honing your leadership skills. We remember you, just nine or ten years old, being chosen to be the quarterback of Waipio Panthers. You learned to play and work with a lot of different boys, from all walks of life. Although you were homeschooled, and mom worried about you with the tough boys, you adapted well with everyone and with your teachable attitude, you gained the respect of your fellow players as well as the many coaches. The game leading to the championship is ingrained in our minds: In the end, it came down to a tie-breaker. The team which gained the most yardage was going to the championship game. Starting from about the 40 yard line, the opposing team got all the way down to the half yard line. You and your teammates now faced a huge undertaking of gaining more yardage to win. In that season of football, you showed that you are not a quitter. You believed in your fellow teammates and believed in yourself. After not gaining much in the 3 downs, your teammates started to feel the defeat, and some even started crying. But on 4th down, you took advantage of the blocks your teammates made, and scored a touchdown to win the game! It was your excitement, your not-giving up attitude, your belief in getting it done, and your encouragement to others that you developed during this exciting season... Your team even went on to win the championship game! We hope you always remember that feeling and how you folks achieved it.. Growing up in kendo with grandpa, you learned so much about discipline, respect, traditions, integrity, manners, your strengths and your weaknesses. You also learned and understood victory and defeat. You won a lot, but you also knew how it feels to lose. And although it's not the best feeling, it has taught you a valuable lesson in life. And you accepted it like a winner. In 2006, you beat your arch nemesis in the kendo match and took 1st place! It wasn't your first(1st place), but it was a big victory. Everyone cheered you on that day. You proved that you have the skills and we're sure that had you continued, you would've given him more of a challenging kendo career (of course in a good way!). Matt you have tenacity, persistence and again, a no give-up attitude. When you have a goal, you reach it! It's such an awesome trait to have. Hope you always remember all the lessons you learned at kendo.. Matt, you are at your best when...-You bought Chuck E. Cheese prizes with your own tickets, for Cherisse! You never failed to always think of your sister first and picked out “girly” prizes without hesitation. And we never prompted you, it was all you.-You took care of your little cousins when they were small. You have a caring nature.-You showed me your first essay you wrote in your first year in public school. You wrote about God and you received an “A”. .. It blew mom away, that you had the conviction to write what you believed, and still impress the “hard ""teacher. You are not afraid to state what you believe.-You are writing and communicating!... I think this would be your next career.-You stood up for what you saw was unjust, and scolded folks at the Punahou Carnival who cut in line, when everyone else stood in a long line for a long time. You have strong values of right and wrong.-You are with your friends. People like you and look up to you. They have trust and respect for you, as you have for them.-You are teachable, trustworthy and accountable. You listen to our instructions - all through your youth, you always listened to us (parents) and any authority figure. Every time we've asked you to do something, you always did it.-You are a leader. Whether it had been as a quarterback for the youth football team, Youth Symphony First Chair violinist, cymbal section leader, Symphony Orchestra president, various committee and club leader in high school and college, a flight instructor, OTS Flight Leader - you always were positive, responsible and carried out your tasks with a heart to serve. Matt, continue to be your best, just as you lived your life and strive to always be better than the day before.. One of Matt’s key leadership qualities that will help him develop as an overall leader is patience in being able to teach a certain topic. Matt and I were roommates in college and during our senior year I was enrolled in an online music class that I greatly struggled with. I often sought Matt’s help when working on various projects for the class. Matt has a unique ability to explain complex topics in a way that allows someone who is really having difficulty find success as I was able to do with regards to this music class. I feel like this attribute will serve Matt well in his future endeavors within the Air National Guard.. Matt has an ability to grasp certain topics that would normally challenge his peers with much greater ease. For our Aviation degree at the University of North Dakota, we were tasked to take the regional jet transition course as part of our upper level curriculum. I was Matt’s simulator partner for this course. I often remember times throughout the course when I was struggling and Matt had a clear grasp on the task at hand. As his partner this really motivated myself to strive to achieve his level of competency. This is a key trait a leader should possess; the ability to master your craft and in doing so motivate other around you to achieve the same level of success.. Matt has a level of dedication that I haven’t seen in many other people I’ve met. He's extremely goal driven. Throughout college he had a clear goal of being accepted to the Hawaii National Guard. All his achievements academically were in pursuit of this singular goal and it ultimately paid off. This will serve Matt well in the National Guard because once he sets his mind to something he will finish it and work to the best of his ability to ensure the end result is the best it can be.. Growing up, I have always admired Matt’s dedication to goals and responsibilities through his numerous extracurricular activities. Matt consistently participated in over five music ensembles, which took an enormous amount of commitment and focus. I was always impressed by the way he balanced his various tasks and goals, in which he did so eloquently. Through this, he demonstrated his ability to prioritize, organize, and manage tasks, which developed him into the strong leader he is today. In addition, Matt excelled at every goal he set for himself, such as being a first violinist in the top high school orchestra, president of his music organization, and graduating with academic honors. These accomplishments truly illustrate his dedication to goals and responsibilities, and serves as a testament to his success in the Air Guard.. When Matt was a flight instructor, he would relay his weekly lessons to me. As an instructor, Matt worked with various learning differences, student abilities, and situations that were challenging to manage at times. However, he always exhibited such compassion with every single student's work. Matt took ownership to develop lesson plans specifically for each individual, in which he listened and understood his students' concerns and questions. Matt's empathy towards his students enabled him to engage in effective leadership and implement strategies that led to his students' accomplishments. Matt's compassion towards his students also translates into his daily actions with peers, colleagues, and myself. I have always viewed Matt as someone to provide infinite amounts of support and guidance, which contributes to his strong leadership qualities.. I have always respected Matt's ability to maintain his composure in difficult situations. Throughout Matt's work as a pilot, he has encountered situations in which you need to remain calm and collected. Being that he's responsible for numerous lives, he always approaches stressful scenarios levelheaded. Such composure allows Matt to clearly access situations, respond decisively, and effectively lead his crew. Outside of work, Matt always maintains a positive mental attitude, which enhances performance and encourages others to strive.. Matthew is an inherent leader. In everything he does, people look up to him and what he does for guidance. He possesses a morale compass that doesn’t stray, and keeps him on the right track at all times. He isn’t someone that takes on leadership roles just for the tittle; rather he takes these roles subconsciously for the betterment of the group he’s working with. In any instance Matthew is bettering not only himself but those he works alongside him; he truly is an asset to anyone he is alongside.. Matthew is a prime example of the difference between management and leadership. Management can be looked upon as power given through job title or rank, while leadership is not a tittle or position, it is power through positive influence. Being given a job title or higher rank does not make you anymore of a leader. Matthew understands this inherently. I have been in work groups as well as scholastic groups with Matthew and in every one of those; he was the leader of the group even if he was not given that managerial title. He positively influenced the groups by encouraging and motivating everyone to produce their best. Matthew would always set the bar higher in his work to encourage others to strive for greatness.. I worked with Matthew at the University of North Dakota, where we were Flight Instructors together. I enjoyed working along side him due to his experience and patience that he demonstrated when he instructed his flight students. Any time I had questions or needed help on how to demonstrate a topic to my students, I would look to Matthew for help. After a busy day of instructing students, Matthew would sit down with me for hours at time to help me better grasp a certain subject so I could better instruct my students. Matthew wouldn’t expect anything in return; he was always there to help anyone that asked. He was one of the most requested instructors at our flight school, and for a good reason. He demonstrated the highest level of professionalism at our flight school and raised the bar of how an instructor at our school should act, and in turn made those better around him.",15

""Just trust me, you'll only want to talk to a few of them, start with Sgt Mothana,"" she said. So as I was sitting next to our NCCD equipment, he came over and asked what I was doing. I don't recall my answer but it was along the lines of, ""I don't get this and the TO doesn't help me."" Without missing a beat, he said, "" Well you have to understand the big picture, let's walk around."" We spent about 30 minutes going to each shop's section. He described how the data flowed and the importance of everyone's position within the unit, stopping every few moments to quiz me on the information he had just relayed. I had been on orders for months and no one had taken the time to explain our mission to me, Sgt Mothana did. I came to the unit at a very unfortunate time. People had given up, there was no morale, our equipment was no longer deployable and the all around atmosphere was disappointment and anger. It would have been very easy for him to take that same approach and avoid speaking to me. He blindly taught an A1C that, for all he knew, he'd never see again. That's the thing about this guy, he uses every opportunity as a teaching moment. Regardless of rank, if he has the capability, he leaves everyone better than he found them.. Don't Get Discouraged A few months after our walkthrough, I landed a job I was immensely under qualified for in cyber security. Without using words like under qualified or undeserving, he used words like, ""most people don't start in security, just take everything you can from it."" Over the course of a year I would get overwhelmed with anxiety of not understanding systems, software, hardware, essentially anything with IT. I've found throughout my career in IT, many people are not like Sgt Mothana. They don't want to teach you what they've spun up in an organization and they cover that up by saying, ""you'll learn best if you just figure it out yourself."" This approach does not work when you are under tight deadlines or working with higher leadership to solve technical issues. To make matters worse, I have a tendency to become flustered and irritated when I cannot grasp something. Learning has always come so easily to me in the past and now I was forced to struggle. Throughout this horrible year, I would periodically text Sgt Mothana with all of these emotions; my frustrations with a lack of knowledge, the animosity between my team, the unwillingness for other teams to want to work with security. Very calmly, he would tell me it won't always be like this. ""Everyone starts off at the bottom, you just have to take everything you can from the job. Volunteer for everything, learn as much as you can. Whatever you do, don't get discouraged by your coworkers. ""This may be the most important lesson he ever taught me. Hard Work Pays Off Networking is awful or awfully important, I'm still struggling with that love hate relationship. What I do know is if you don't understand networking, you don't understand IT. This was a difficult lesson to handle. Sgt Mothana heavily prides himself on networking and always troubleshoots using the OSI model. I fought this issue for a long time until I gave in. I'm very glad I did, even if it continues to be an ongoing battle between me and the 1600 pages of CCNA. As I mentioned in the second story, learning has always come easy. This has not been the case in IT, specifically in this area. I failed not once, but twice before I made the certification on the third time. Of course the words of encouragement and the don't give ups helped throughout the time but it was never a walk in the park. If you know Mothana, you know he has a few famous lines. ""What do you mean?"" - Your question makes no sense and I need you to explain what you're asking so I can help. ""Why though?"" - He doesn't understand something and will literally keep saying this until he's satisfied.""I worked my ass off for years so I no longer have to work my ass off"" - my personal favorite line. This is used when someone makes fun of his nonchalant job that rarely requires an alarm. A few weeks ago, I had the pleasure of going through a course that intel is not normally slotted for. During this course, we heavily focused on topics such as Network Fundamentals, OCO, and traffic analysis. I sat next to a contractor that had mentioned he obtained his CCNA a few months ago through a boot camp class. During our blocks together, specifically OCO, I found myself explaining many things that seemed common knowledge. While conducting an exploit on the network, it is vital to have an understanding of where you are at all times. In order to do this, you need to have foundational networking knowledge. You can imagine my surprise when the contractor was lost on simple concepts such as NAT-ing or pivoting. I reached out to Mothana and was surprised at his answer. He said, "" This is why employers test you when you say you have the CCNA. It is very easy to tell who worked for it and who took a boot camp class. You deserved yours. ""Many people knock Mothana for his teaching method, he has a tendency to come off strong. This is only because he wants people to push themselves and do their best. Once that occurs, even its rare, he will commend you on your efforts. That's the sign of a good leader. If you're reading this, graduate so you can be activated with me and commend me daily for 6months.. Once Kasim and I were working on a team in which a member was not doing his part. Kasim was patient at first, trying to get the delinquent airman to do his job. After it was clear the airman did not care and was exhibiting dereliction of duty, Kasim stepped in. He took the airman aside and provided the appropriate amount of discipline. After their meeting the airman was more engaged and responsible towards the mission objectives. I was impressed with Kasim's dedication to the mission and how he handled this situation.. Once Kasim was providing a training session on a highly technical topic for a team of junior enlisted airmen. He was efficiently covering a complicated topic and while most understood his lesson, some were lost. Kasim was able to identify that some airmen were struggling with the content. At this point he paused, consoled the distressed airmen and walked them through the content once or twice again. Once he felt the female airman successfully grasped the concept, he moved forward with the lesson. I was impressed that Kasim was keen and observant enough to sense that something was not right, and although he didn't want to stop to do a review, he stopped and supported the airmen. He showed that he respects and understands that not everyone learns at the same rate or through the same methods.. During the Global Medic exercise, Kasim Mothana taught me everything I needed to know about theatre deployable communications. I was new to 42d Combat Communications Squadron and Mothana took me under his wing. Through his leadership and mentoring my knowledge of computer systems exceeded pass the requirements of the mission. This allowed me to achieve a greater understanding of the combat comm. mission and, as a result, my role within the unit was elevated.",6

He is a smart, interesting and energetic person, maybe that's why everyone likes him. The most impressive thing about Ryan is his ability to think on his feet. He can process his thoughts very quickly and express his ideas in an organized matter.. Cadet Saldana's temperament and mood are a great morale booster for the team. He has a unique gift of cheering others up through his energetic personality. Cadet Saldana's dedication to excellence is inspirational. He takes the time to do procedures right and well. He continuously improves on his room inspection items which motivate me to want to do the same.. Cadet Saldana's ability to take on roles of responsible that are under scrutiny from staff is motivational. He is able to keep his cool and still be positive amongst the stress of those positions. In this he has set a good example for me and others.. When I received this request, at first I thought ""oh this will be easy"", only three stores where Ryan has demonstrated grace and strength. But then, it hit me, only THREE, how can I narrow down all that you are, to three stories. When everyday I have known you, you continuously surpass all expectations and inspire me to be a better person. I decided one would have to be about how we first met. During an alumni event at St. Mary's University, I was near the group I was advising at the time, when this oh so handsome gentleman walked up. Without a care in the world that he was about to be surrounded by a swarm of young intelligent and independent college women. You just had such an amazing SPIRIT. It made those around you want to smile and be pleasant with you. I mean I didn't even know you, but I could feel your sincerity. Then you began making small talk and sharing about yourself. Wow, even his posture and vocabulary are refreshing I thought. Not to mention the fact that even though you were modestly sharing, you continued to press me about who I was and what interested me. In fact, I enjoyed your CHARISMATIC presence and conversation so much, I found myself looking for you, to strike up another topic. Anything. Just so I could continue to have you inspire and ah me. Of course this first encounter would not be the last. And I thank God for that.. In no time at all, I found myself head over heels for this PERSISTENT and ADVENTUROUS man. It wasn't always easy for me though, I was so scared of how much you made me feel. It was all new to me, in the beginning of our relationship we had to manage through the weeds of a long distance love, with two differ timeframes of awake hours. How could it be done I thought. You in one city and I in another. But not once did I YOU make me believe I was right; alone or forgotten, I was not. At any point and time I knew I could count on you. Whether it meant you were driving straight after work to come see me for only an hour or so, but then having to drive straight back because I was about to go to work and you needed your rest for the next day. As time passed I thought less and less about how this relationship might not work, and more about what new journey we were about to goon. Because you never gave up, I never gave up. I could see and feel that you were not going to let this fall a part, no matter the work it took. And no matter how emotionally shut off or forward I was. Then the memories started. We were taking on our fears and accomplishing new millstones together. From conquering worries of heights, by jumping off hill tops and going trapezing. To trying new foods and crafts. You were never worried about what others would think or what the outcome may be. All you cared about was showing me and yourself the many wonders around us. Thank you. I would never have gone beyond who I am if not for you. You are inspiration.. Two years later and it still shocks me, how each day I fall more and more in love with you than the day before. How is that possible. Just when I thought I couldn't care for you anymore than I already do, you prove me wrong by just being you. I know what you are thinking, I'm never wrong, ha ha. But in this case I am. Ryan, you have shown not only me, but also our family and friends just how wonderful of a person you are, by being yourself. To the point where my family, now calls you family, and would do anything for you. You are such a LEADER and INTELLIGENT beyond your years, that anyone who meets you, believes in themselves so much more, after just one conversation. I wish I could say that, that is shocking. But I can't. I've had many conversations with you, and each one more impactful than the last. You know so much, and that which you do not know, you research and retain. What a skill set you have. I guess what I really want to tell you in this story, is that you are so much more than one person. You have left a little of yourself in everyone who meets you. Willing to give all of yourself for what you believe in, and care only for others, no matter how stretched you may be. That's BRAVERY, even when you are scared or worried or tired or down, you give and give. God did something amazing and beautiful when he made you. Please know that. And never forget it. I love you deeply.. On a cold winter day Ryan, my cousin, my sister, and I went out to go see a movie. My sister said something very rude to me that hurt my feelings, and prevented me from wanting to leave the vehicle. Ryan was the one to stay back and talk to me, ensuring I feel better. Ryan spoke to me, listened to my side, and pointed out different points in the issue bringing understanding to the matter. He helped me realize that I am going to be okay no matter what. He even shared a similar and personal situation from his past to help me understand that I was not alone, and everyone goes through hard stuff in life. From then on, I have always felt support and love from Ryan, and that is why till this day I trust him with everything. Through this situation Ryan showed such strength and compassion for someone that he recently met, and that is why Ryan will always be the kindest person I have ever met.. Ryan likes to plan very fun things that my family and I like to partake in. On one of the planned days the weather changed and prevented us from doing one of the activities. Ryan did not complain, get angry, or make the group feel uncomfortable. He quickly adjusted and thought of something else fun to do. This may seem minuscule, but I am a control freak so when things don't go my way I freak out and itis noticed by those around me. So when I saw Ryan handle it with ease and even make it better I was impressed. It showed that he is able to handle any situation, bad or good, and still bring forth positivity. His positivity is contagious and it makes me want to handle situations just as well as he handles them.. It is very hard to be away from your family and friends if you're close to them. Ryan is doing just that, and I am not worried that he is letting that hold him back from being happy. He is able to make any situation as positive as possible. He knew that he would have to go away and that shows strength, because when I got sad he was going away he tried to make me feel better about it instead of the other way around. His perspective on things is outstanding because no matter what to him, everything is going to be okay. From him I learned this mindset.. I first remember seeing Cadet Saldana step up (forced) into a leadership role when we had the dorm room reassignment. During this time he remained calm but acted quickly to ensure that our team was taken care of and complied with the instructions. With limited information and direction from senior leadership, Saldana took charge and made it happen.. Cadet Saldana has also been attentive and analytical in class. He has asked clarifying questions that helped us all understand things more fully.. Cadet Saldana is our flight PT Leader and has quickly become familiar with both the OTSMAN prescribed procedures and those prescribed by our squadron leadership. He has initiative and volunteers for things regularly like PTL, guidon bearer, etc.",13

I knew very quickly that Pete had the right stuff. We took an SR22 out for the checkout. Pete sat there calmly while I put the aircraft through the usual stalls, steep turns and lazy eights. He only spoke when it was worthwhile. providing valuable suggestions and discussing the airplanes strengths and weaknesses. When we landed, we discussed the possibility of my purchasing a composite airplane. He suggested that I check out a Columbia as he thought I might like the handling and performance better. His input led me to the aircraft that I eventually purchased. Without his input I might never have looked there, which leads us to story number 2.. I purchased a Columbia 300 based solely on Pete's knowledge of me and his experience with the Columbia airframe. The airplane was in Oregon and I live near Pete in Southern Indiana. I asked Pete if he had the time and was willing to fly out and ferry the airplane back for me at 100 dollars per flight hour and expenses. Pete told me that he had an orientation ride with the Air Force reserve scheduled in Oregon at the same time I needed the plane ferried. I bought him his ticket to Oregon. After his flight in an F-15, he got up the next morning and flew my new Columbia back to Louisville. When I got out the cash to pay him, he refused to take the money for the ferry flight saying that the expenses for his trip were more than enough pay and he had enjoyed the flight back. A lesser man would have taken the money. He had successfully ferried an unfamiliar airplane back over the rocky mountains. This leads us to our last story.. My insurance company required 3 hours of instruction and 15 take offs and landings. Pete was of course my instructor of choice. Three things that I will always remember about the experience. We flew to Huntsville Alabama. On final approach my airspeed was a little slow. Pete very calmly said "" a little slow Dave"". no panic, very confident. After landing, my ride didn't show up and Pete stuck around and added an Uber app to my phone and got my ride on its way before he flew the airplane back to KJVY. Two days later we completed my 15 landings, By the the end of the session I had them looking pretty good. A few ""greasers"". When we landed and walked into the FBO, an attractive young lady pilot looked at Pete and said ""those were some great landings ""Pete looked at her and said ""I can't take any credit for that, Dave was doing all the flying"". To me that was a sign of great character on Pete's part. He is a very special young man and we are fortunate to have his kind in the service of our country.. I think we have been calling Pete a used car salesmen forever, he always seems to sell something no matter what it is. From refurbishing X Boxes to flipping cars, he is always on the look out for a creative way to profit himself.. Pete is always good at meeting new people and bringing them together. He makes plans and sticks to them whether it be a golf session, trip, or party.. Pete can be incredibly thoughtful and supportive. I remember how appreciative I was that he cleaned my car for my birthday. He is does not shy away from acts of service.. Way up north where twin rivers meet, lives a kick ass son, nicked named Meat....Ol’ Doyle next door was suffering from the loss of his wife Brenda. His yard was amess and he was overwhelmed with the littlest things. We were shooting off rockets or flying white wings in the back yard or some other activity and I remember you saying, “maybe we can help Doyle. ""Well, the next morning bright and early we fired up the old JD 216 and hooked up the trailer. Threw a few rakes and shovels in back and got to work. It was a warm morning. Maybe a little misty. Just the very first light of the morning. You must have been about 8 or 9 years old. You drove the tractor and every time you stopped, you’d jump off and get to work. You knew that you were helping out a neighbor in need. Things like this early in life are tremendous character builders. You Pete, brought this on all by yourself. It was just the beginning of the man you have become.. All the ladies came for a ringside seat, just to watch that half-breed teach his peeps. The scene was set at windy mill, by the brick shithouse, high on the hill. Who'd have thunk it? You saved your money, studied and kicked butt throughout your flight training. Now you’re a flight instructor. The first person a new flight student interacts with as they begin their life-long dream of becoming a pilot. Hell, there's a zillion flight instructors....You will always have a special place in their lives. All I’ve ever heard from any of your students, parents and friends is heartfelt praise and admiration for your piloting skills, enthusiasm and motivation. You have a unique ability to draw them to the “flame”. Proud attributes! You’ll never be just one of a zillion flight instructors. You’re one in a zillion flight instructors. (I would have underlined “in” but I couldn’t figure it out.)You never wavered from expecting excellence from your students. Leading by example, and always keeping the old saying in your hip pocket, “If there is a doubt, there is no doubt.” You literally held their lives in your hand when you would set them free to solo. That my son, is a wonderful achievement! Respect of your peers, students and anyone you’ve been associated with in life, is with the highest regard. You Pete, have that!. When they asked that half-breed of his amazing feat, He said, Boys, I’m going to be a Fighter Pilot, now give me that seat! You've interviewed a bunch of times with Guard units all over the country. Beat that dead horse. Never once have I heard anything but over the top praise for you from my Fighter Pilot buddies in each unit. When you were hired by Klamath Falls, you grabbed the bull by the horns and went back out there to grip and grin with the cadre, mostly on your own dime. This, my young son, does not go unnoticed! You spent time with the heavy hitters as well as your future brothers on the line. They got to meet you and have already begun an honest respect that you will hold forever. You treated everyone you met with the real you. Of course I have a million other stories in my detailed files. Airplane deliveries, cop cars for airporters. What some would call scud running. Buying and selling cars. Your black belt. Building a canoe. Working at the farm. Camping and sailing trips. Learning to kite board in Aruba. Your instrument training. (I do think a few light bulbs flickered during that!)All of these things made you the kick ass dude that you are. You’re a gifted human. If that wasn’t enough, just remember the most important thing...Your ol’ man is proud of you!. In the Boy Scouts, Pete was always one of the ""cool"" kids. All of the younger kids admired him and wanted to be like him. He led by example and other scouts followed that example. At the time I don't think Pete knew they were watching but they were. The other the I have noticed in the time I have known Pete is his drive and initiative. When he becomes focused on something, he will achieve it, whatever that might be. For example, one Klondike Derby in Boy Scouts. We were in a fire building competition, it was a race to build a fire big enough to burn a string that was around a foot and a half tall. There were not strict rules, participants could use the items they brought. Pete taking initiative, ran full speed back to our camp and retrieved an aerosol can that allowed us to burn the rope in record time. We were later disqualified for this but I maintain that we were still within in the rules and are the true winners of that competition due to Pete's drive and initiative.. Pete has always been a master negotiator and master of influence. I have never meta more convincing person. He is a truly gifted salesman and has great ingenuity. He has great research skills which I have seen demonstrated many times in his hobbies and career, whether it be cars, guns, airplanes, etc. When finds something he is passionate about he pursues it. I remember in our youth playing video games I was amazed at his Call of Duty abilities and the levels he achieved due to his persistence. Later in college, he had that same persistence and drive in getting good grades, becoming a pilot, and becoming an instructor. Pete is the type of guy you want on your side as he is intelligent, driven and a master negotiator. I think his hidden talent would be that every where he goes people look up to him. It always amazes me when I meet people with Pete how many of them are drawn to him and look up to him, more than he realizes.. In college, Pete and I were in the same Geography lab. We studied for that class together and it was one of the first times I really got to see Pete's knowledge he had learned in preparation to becoming a pilot. The knowledge he demonstrated to me about a subject that was easy for him was impressive. I admit I had a very base knowledge going into the class and Pete helped me be proficient. Pete has the ability to teach and help others learn. I never did beat him on any assignment in that class. This was when I really saw first hand Pete's dedication to academics. Pete had set a goal of being a pilot, getting a degree, and joining the Air Force and was willing to do whatever it took to get there. I am still to this day in admiration of his dedication and drive to reach that goal. I am confident that with his drive, intelligence, and natural leadership skills, he will continue to do great things.. One of Cadet Bristol's greatest strengths in my opinion is his constant willingness to find more accurate or efficient answers, outcomes, ways and means to every single aspect of his life. I've never met anyone with more initiative to look something up, research and react. While this may sound simple, it has benefited every aspect of his life and had the invaluable affect on the people around him.. Pete always tries to include his friends in family in experiences that we would not otherwise have an opportunity for. On one occasion he invited three of us to take a flight out of town for a breakfast. It seemed he saw this as an opportunity to help his guest bond as there was a previous rift between us. After a great flight and breakfast we returned to the tarmac to find the plane with a flight tire. Being about 2h from home and realizing everyone's Sunday schedules starting to unravel Pete quickly had to juggle a plan of action thinking first about his guests needs. As it was Sunday there weren't any on site A&Ps. With all of us wondering ""what now?"" Pete quickly tried to contact mechanics offsite all while gathering lodging and rental car reservations for his guests to decide what would work best. He had these ready for us in a matter of minutes while maintaining an admirable sense of ease a calm for the group. This quick thinking led to a mechanic driving in to change the tire and getting his guest back home safe. This was one of many moments where Pete stepped up and solved the issue with a great sense of leadership and responsibility.. I have had the pleasure to see Pete embark on his career as a pilot from start to OTS. Leading to another great strength I can note his keenness to grow the pilot community at every opportunity. From meeting someone off the street all the way to my own father, Pete always puts in the time to discuss or even teach those around him about piloting. I've sat on conversations where Pete would arrange discovery flights for people he had never met and kept contact with them to to encourage pursuit on their interest in becoming pilots. I've taken flights with he and his students witnessing first hand his passion and dedication for teaching flight. I've had the pleasure of learning from him as a student and a friend where he's constantly shown patience in helping me understand from a basic level piloting. Whether it's clearing his schedule to take a flight or offering his own literature to further someone's education, Pete has never shown disinterest. Not only does this continually prove great character it also builds on the community of pilots, students and dreamers around him.. Staying positive While flying together there were many times when things went wrong or the circumstances dictated for the plan to change in a way that affected us negatively. I don't recall one time where you allowed your attitude to turn negative. In fact one of our first flights you were put to the test and were able to overcome difficult and unfamiliar circumstance with a positive attitude and that characteristic stood out time and time again when others would allow their attitude to turn sour.. Hard Work Not many people like to work, much less work hard. You are always willing to jump in and complete a task even when it is someone else's responsibility. I believe that allows you to excel in difficult circumstances when other people falter because you are accustomed to doing whatever it takes to get something done correctly.. Smart Unfortunately most people take the easy road and wait for Information to be spoon fed to them, and often these people do the minimum to pass. But you always take on new Information and and study it until you not only know it but are able to use it. I don't believe your ""smart"" comes from the ability to remember and regurgitate facts but the ability to retain information and practice with it until it allows you to perform and react to circumstances efficiently.. One of my favorite memories of you is when you decided to learn how to ride a bicycle without training wheels. I think you were about 5 years old. You told me to take the training wheels off. You rode your bike down the hill in our back yard about twenty or more times. Falling over on each try. You did however make it a little further each time. It was a long way to push your bike back up to the top to start again. I told you I can put the training wheels back on if you want me to. You said ""NO, I am not putting them back on I will learn to ride this bike today.” You did just that. Went from riding in the yard to the driveway and then the subdivision. Soon you were building dare devil jumps to ride over. I remember riding down that long trail alongside the Ohio river from Joe’s crab shack with you and Kelsey. Nothing could stop you once you got going. Your commitment, determination and persistence enabled you to successfully learn how to ride your little green bicycle. I was so proud of you that day as I am today.. Your goal setting to acquire your dream job of flying a fighter was key to your successful appointment to the Oregon Air National Guard Unit to instruct in the F-15.Taking private flying lessons to get your private pilot license, commercial, instrument and instructor is a huge accomplishment and a step to getting you closer to your goal. Flying all hours of the night and day to accumulate hours. You set very high work ethics for yourself. Working while attending Collage is no easy task, it taught you time management and the value of a dollar. Although you did learn that value when you were a child. Making money fixing and selling things. Obtaining interviews to the Air National Guard units by filing out all the right forms and having them in on time was not easy. You went after it and did not give up. Interview time you left nothing to chance. You meticulously prepared for each interview. Your persistence and determination landed you your dream job. I am so proud of you as you should be of yourself.. Pete your thoughtfulness and compassion for others and animals is outstanding. Your willingness to be there when people need you is wonderful. I can’t begin to tell you how much I appreciated you being there for me when your Grandpa Waldo was leaving us. It meant the world to me for you to be there with me, as you have many times over. Not only do you take care of me when I need it, you also step up to the plate when your dad or sister need help too. Your willingness to help others succeed is commendable. Getting Ian and Patrick jobs for instance. Your thoughtfulness in gift giving to your family and girlfriends shows us that we matter to you and you took the time to make us matter. Your responsibility and compassion for your fine furry friends is so cool. The ability to show love to an animal is fine quality you have. Making sure their everyday living needs are met, worrying about them if they don’t come in at night is what a caring person does. You will make one hell of a husband and father one day, with your caring personality.",21

His work ethic is incredible and it has been like that for years, ever since high school. Josh always had a job doing something back in New Jersey. Whether it was working at church or even just mowing lawns around the neighborhood, Josh was always working somewhere. He could always be counted on when something needed to be done. He used to provide IT services for our church and the school there, and he would spend all hours of the day/night trying to fix the constant issues that developed with their computers. He would work tirelessly when trying to fix a problem, sometimes not getting home until after midnight. His work ethic and dependability continued through college. After he graduated he went to work in the admissions department of his school. Through hard work, he was the director of the entire admissions department within a year (2years), getting promoted over people who had been there a lot longer. It was pretty impressive.. Josh has always found a way to remain positive even when faced with shitty situations. Last spring he started Air Force OTS. He has been working towards it for along time, and I was so proud when he got accepted and began training. When I found out that he was dropped from training a few weeks into it, it almost seemed like I was more bummed about it than he was (obviously, I know it was tougher on him, but he stayed so positive). Though the whole situation was upsetting, he seemed to stay so optimistic, didn't get discouraged, especially in front of others, and he didn't let it effect him for long. He was able to see the good in the situation despite the setback. He went back home and for the next year he did what he had to do to get back into the course. Whenever I talked to him about getting back into training, he was always upbeat. Even when he was having difficulties with non-responsive Air Force recruiters, and I could tell he was frustrated, he still kept a positive outlook.. Josh, I don't have a third story. Not that you don't have other strengths, I'm just really bad at doing stuff like this. Just wanted to let you know that I'm really proud of who you've grown up to be, how you handle adversity, and all that you have accomplished over the last few years. You've done so well at everything you set out to do....just get better at sit-ups. You are a great example to anyone. Keep up the phenomenal work. Proud of you, bro.. Joshua was best whenever there was work to be done. Josh is the 6th of 8 children who are each hard workers but Josh was by far the hardest working child in the family. Josh always approached any work with a smile and determination to go beyond what was expected. For example, all of Josh’s brothers were required to mow the lawn when they were old enough to handle the job but Josh was the one that also did the edging, trimming, weeding and more without being asked. He shoveled the snow off our walkway, sidewalk, and driveway—full width, clean down to the pavement. And then he went off to shovel the walks of elderly neighbors. He walked a neighbor’s dog for years and took care of animals for other families on vacation. In his teen years, Josh worked at our church and school as the IT expert. He ran cables, fixed computers, trained teachers, taught computer skills to students, and then did anything else that was asked of him. In short, the teachers, principal and pastor depended on Josh to keep a complex network up and running. Josh maintained his strong work ethic while attending Essex County Community College and earning his bachelor degree at Evangel University. Besides his studies, he always had a part-time job that he performed with excellence. He also learned that he couldn’t do all the work that everyone wanted done. He sometimes needs to say “No.” Josh began to use his team-building and leadership skills to leverage his own efforts and accomplish more with a team. After graduating from Evangel, Josh wanted to “give back” to the University so he took a job as an admissions counsellor. Soon, he was leading teams of young graduates on recruiting trips around the country. As enrolment grew from his team’s efforts, he was given greater responsibilities and achieved more. In less than 3 years, he was promoted to Director of Admissions. Josh was always the go-to guy in our home, in our church, in college and in the workforce. It is deep in his core and he will continue to be the go-to guy when a job needs to be done in the Air Force.. Joshua was at his best when he was captain of the local high school Ultimate Frisbee team. Joshua was homeschooled but the rules of the USA Ultimate association permitted homeschoolers to play for their local high school—in Joshua’s case, this was Columbia High School (CHS) where the game of Ultimate was invented and first played in 1968.Two of Josh’s older brothers and an older sister also played for CHS and were chosen to be captains of their respective teams even though none of them attended CHS. While Josh was an outstanding player during his underclass years, he was also an amazing leader on and off the field so it was not surprising that he too was selected to be captain in his senior year. CHS Ultimate is a student-run, club sport at the school so the captain was responsible for everything: recruiting and training new players, organizing fund-raising, scheduling games and tournaments, and being the team's leader on the field. But it was more than just being good in a sport. Ultimate players embrace the “Spirit of the Game.” (“The spirit of sportsmanship that places the responsibility for fair play on the player. Highly competitive play is encouraged, but never at the expense of mutual respect among competitors, adherence to the agreed upon rules, or the basic joy of play.” USAUltimate.org) Joshua embodied that spirit: always encouraging, always supporting, always inspiring his teammates to become the best persons and players they could be. He became a true servant leader by investing in his teammates. His teammates responded to his leadership by performing beyond what they thought was possible, winning both the New Jersey State Ultimate Championship and the Northeast Regional Ultimate Championship. And, to cap his senior year, Josh was chosen to play for Team USA, which won the Gold Medal at the 2008 World Junior Ultimate Championships in Vancouver.. Joshua was at his best when he approached his future father-in-law and asked for Melodee's hand in marriage. Josh and Melodee met at our church when they were in middle school. They became best friends and then a couple in high school. In fact, when he was 18, Josh told me that he wanted to marry Melodee. I told him, “No way, you’re too young, you need to go to college, etc., etc.” I didn’t convince Josh until I told him that, once he married Melodee, he would be responsible for Melodee’s college tuition. This was Josh’s first real understanding of the responsibilities and authority of a father. Three years later, Josh made an appointment to have dinner with Melodee’s father and asked for permission to get married, which was granted enthusiastically. So, a few weeks later on New Year’s Eve, Josh proposed and Melodee accepted. Before they went back to college, Josh and Melodee met with her father to discuss the wedding that they wanted to have in June. To their surprise, he said, “No. ”Melodee was in tears and Josh was upset that he had waited so long, gotten her dad's permission, and was now being told that he had to wait another 18 months. Josh called me and asked me to intervene and convince Melodee’s father that they should get married in a few months. I said that I would not do that. Melodee’s father had noted that they both needed another 18 months to finish their degrees and, until Josh had his degree, he would be unable to support his daughter. I said, “Melodee’s dad is right. He has said that you can get married but he wants you to wait until you are ready to be a husband and father.”“Of course,” I said, “you can do what most other people your age would do today and ignore her father’s wishes and do your own thing. But you will be disrespecting Melodee’s dad and your relationship with him will be damaged, possibly for the rest of your marriage. Or you can submit to his authority and abide by his request that you wait. ”Further, if you do not submit to his authority, you will have shown yourself not to be a man who understands the proper use of authority and Melodee may not submit to your authority as the head of the household. ""Well, the long and short is that Josh spoke to Melodee and convinced her that their full compliance with her dad’s wishes was the best way. Melodee’s father was very appreciative of their mature response to his request. And, 5 years later, all 3 of them have a wonderful relationship. In Matthew 8, Jesus encountered a centurion whose servant was dying. The centurion begged Jesus not to come to his home because “like you, I am a man under authority.” The centurion knew that, as a man under authority, all Jesus had to do was to speak a command and it would be done. The centurion recognized that his authority to command men was due exclusively to the centurion’s complete submission to the authority of those in command above him. This, too, is one of Joshua’s great strengths. He recognizes those in authority and submits to that authority completely. Because he demonstrates such respect for authority, colleagues at his various jobs have willingly submitted to his authority and have followed his lead, whether or not he’s been “the boss.”. Have you ever asked someone for computer help and you sensed that, even though they tried to explain things to you, they had that impatient edge to their voice that made you feel not so smart and just not “with it”? Well, I have had to ask Josh, my son, for computer help umpteen times over the last many years, and I am always amazed how he has never gotten impatient with me and has always taken the time to explain things simply, clearly, and gently. His tone has always been encouraging and he has focused on helping me learn a concept step-by-step so I could do it again another time without his help. Even for his 89-year-old grandfather, Josh has always been the “go-to” computer guy via remote access/management. He has never complained or grumbled, even when things got pretty messed up with his Papa's desktop and files. And, he has always been able to clean things up and restore the computer so his grandfather could use it. Josh has also been a great teacher for others outside the family. He worked for many years at our church. He ran the sound system and was the IT consultant for the church and the church’s school. Whether it was running wires or maintaining the dozens of computers for the administration and teachers, he was an invaluable asset to the staff. When an IT crisis arose (as happened often), Josh was on the job and everyone so appreciated him. Not only was he capable, but he was so nice. He would work overtime to finish a job so the school and church technology could function at its best and was always pleasant to work with.. To be a good leader, one must first learn how to be properly submitted to authority. I see Josh as someone who has learned this lesson in life, and it has enabled him to lead well, earning the respect of those under him. As I think back over Josh’s teen years, I chuckle as I recall that time in his life when he was “struggling” with the concept of submission to authority. When he was about 15, I think, he and I were having some “issues” - just mom and teen aged son things that were causing a lot of friction between us. There were some pretty intense arguments and he would get quite mad at times. But we always talked things over after, made peace, and moved on. Then, I remember a day not long after when I heard him counselling a friend on the phone who was having a lot of trouble with his parents. Josh was saying something to the effect that his friend needed to just do what his parents asked or required, even if he didn’t like it, because 1) his parents were right, 2) it would not hurt his friend to obey, and, 3) if his friend just respected his parents’ right to require certain things and abided by them, his relationship with them would improve overtime (and probably sooner rather than later). Needless to say, I was quite surprised and proud to hear him giving such mature advice to his friend. In fact, from the age of about 17 on, Josh was often sought out by his friends for advice and counsel about difficult situations in their lives. He became someone who was respected for his understanding, wisdom, and wise counsel. Even at home, our relationship improved and it has continued to be one of genuine love, respect, camaraderie, and appreciation for one another.. When Josh and his wife, Melodee, graduated from Evangel University in Springfield, Missouri, he decided to give three years of service back to the school while Dee took a job as an elementary teacher at an inner-city school in town. He had been a well-respected Resident Assistant in the dorms as an under-grad and had participated on student teams that traveled to other locations for missions work. After graduation, he was immediately offered a job as an admissions counselor and worked tirelessly to improve the admissions outreaches to the Northeast and Mid-west. Within two years, admission levels increased tremendously and he was promoted up through the ranks, becoming Director of Admissions for the university. He was highly respected and worked well with all his colleagues. But he had always had the dream of going into the Air Force and using his skills in cyber technology. When he was accepted into the OTS class in 2016, the Admissions Department was very sad to lose him. The plan was set: Josh would leave his job at Evangel, he would attend OTS, he would graduate just in time for Baby #1 to be due, and he and Dee and baby would be ready for the next adventure. But, things don’t always happen the way we plan. A couple of sit-ups short on the PT test, and he was out of OTS after a week and on a bus back to Springfield, with no job, baby due, bills to pay, and wondering, “What now?” But true to Josh’s character, he got busy and got back in the game. Evangel offered him a job in Admissions (not as director, but as an advisor/counselor) and his colleagues were happy to have him back. He didn’t complain that he was in a lower position with less pay. He just went to work and did a great job. He had such favor with the organization that is boss offered him the option to stay as long as he needed while he pursued other opportunities to return to the IT field. Then, Baby Reagan arrived, 3 weeks early! (He would have missed the birth had he still been at OTS.) A short while later, through a contact at work, his name was given to the local Assemblies of God Credit Union, an organization in need of an IT expert. On his interview, he told them that, if the Air Force had another class for him, he would take it. But the credit union liked him well enough and offered him the position. He took the job, and quickly became an indispensable member of their team. He overhauled their dated systems, pressed for new hardware and software, successfully fixed and coordinated the systems for their different offices, and was eventually promoted to a higher position. As for his Air Force goals, he reapplied, retook the PT readiness test, passed it, and waited, and waited...When word came of a class assignment, he informed his employer that he would be leaving. His boss said, “We don’t want to lose you. If we offered you a promotion and more money, would you stay?” Well, we know he didn't, because I am writing scenarios about Josh’s leadership and character for OTS. But through all the experiences of the last year, the disappointments as well as the joys and successes, Josh has learned so much about persevering through trials, humbling himself and not complaining when having to take steps back, and leading with patience, even as others have been patient with him. He is quite a different man than he was one year ago, and the maturity that comes with the ups and downs of life have made him better than ever as a leader and mentor.. Josh is a fixer. When there are things that need to be fixed at home, he finds a way to fix it and not just patch it up until it breaks again. Whether it be reading articles online, watching a video, or analyzing the problem and coming up with his own solution, he will do whatever it takes to solve the problem. A couple of months ago our washer machine broke because I overloaded it. He didn’t get angry, he just said, ""Well I might be able to fix it.” He watched a video, brought the needed parts, and spent the next two days trying to fix it. And he did. He is patient, willing to analyze the situation, and correct the problem. He didn’t give up after hours of working on it the first day. He didn’t complain that it was me who broke it. He did get a good laugh out of my shenanigans, but that’s another story to tell. He continued to search for a solution and the next day was able to get the washing machine up and running. This is Josh. He sees a problem and doesn’t give up until it is fixed.. I would describe Josh as selfless. He selflessly gives of his time to help others and does so with a cheerful attitude. It doesn’t matter who you are, he is willing to take the time to help you and be there for you. When I became an elementary schoolteacher I never realized how much grading, cutting, printing, and stapling I would do. Almost every day I would come home with a huge list of things to do. To go to sleep at a reasonable time and enjoy sitting down for dinner, Josh, without complaining, would offer to help me. He would sit there and cut 100s of cards for me. He would laminate and cut out decorations and other teaching resources. He would grade math homework, tests, and other material that needed to be done. He never complained even though I knew it was Josh is selfless with his time. He could have easily done other things but instead chose to be right by my side helping to ease the load of being a teacher. Another example of his selflessness is when our friends called us 20minutes before they had decided that both wanted to attend a networking event but now needed someone to go to their place and watch their three-year-old who would be going to sleep very soon. Josh was exhausted from work and had already changed into comfortable clothes and made his way to the couch for some much needed relaxation. But when we got their message, he said out loud to me that he didn't mind watching their son while I stayed because our little one had already gone to bed and that this networking event they wanted to go would be an amazing opportunity for them to connect with other pastors and leaders. He thinks about other people and doesn't mind going out of his way to help others.. Josh is someone who is able to remain focused and level-headed amidst stressful situations. Before leaving to OTS, we decided that while he was away that our 1-year-old and I would stay with family, a thousand miles away. The month leading up to the big move we had a list of to-do items that seemed to be endless. We had to pack up a trailer, buy a second car, and make plans towards a future that wasn’t guaranteed. We were operating on full faith that with this premature move everything would workout. Talk about stressful situations, this was the perfect example. While I continued to be bogged down with stress and fears and letting it be known to him, Josh remained focused and continuously reminded me of what our goals were for our family--sacrifice now to ensure a better future for our family. I was scheduled to leave on Sunday morning and the Tuesday before we had yet to secure a vehicle that would be a smart investment. I was worried but Josh unrelentingly remained level-headed and focused on every task needing to be done. We finally secured a vehicle Tuesday evening but the pressure with having to move by a certain time continued to bring me down. We had so much that needed to be done—all while raising a one-year-old—that I wasn’t able to leave on the day scheduled. My daughter and I left a whole day and a half later because we constantly kept dealing with unforeseen circumstances. Throughout the whole process of moving, Josh was a constant pillar of strength and calmness. When I would be consumed with panic, anxiety, stress, and worry, it was Josh who would refocus my attention, help me dwell on the positives, and keep us moving forward. He doesn’t panic or become hard to deal with when under pressure. He knows how to keep a calm attitude in order to execute the plans. Josh does well under pressure and when things get tough he is able to navigate through the chaos, stay focused and help others stay focused in order to get things moving forward.. My first memories of Josh came while we attended the same university for a couple of years. I remember thinking to myself, ""How can one person be this talented?"" I was surprised by the amount of different things Josh could do with a high level of competence. His intellect was on display by pursuing a degree in Computer Sciences. His athletic abilities were shown during intramural sports, especially ultimate Frisbee. His social skills were amplified during his job in the Evangel University Admissions Department. He ran sound/lights at the church we attended. He would even cut hair; both his own and for other students on campus. The reason that I mention all of these different things is simply to show how quickly Josh can master different topics/activities. He has high enough intelligence across all areas to succeed in any challenge that comes his way. He has a natural desire to learn, excel, and master atopic.. The second characteristic I would like to highlight is Josh's humility. In the previous story, I described how Josh could gain mastery and excel in whatever field he chose due to his problem solving abilities and  his plethora of talents. This story will magnify the humility and character by which he lives his life. It is not often that we run into people that we admire their humility. Part of the reason I was so surprised by all his talents (as stated in story 1) was that he never boasted or bragged about them thus I never knew they existed. It was never his focus nor intention to make sure others were directly aware of these abilities for his own personal gain. His leadership skills and potential are accentuated by his lack of desire to advance his own agenda. By being so humble and so relatable, it makes him approachable and trustworthy. People have no reservations about his character and we can trust that his intentions are legitimate. Therefore we obtain a sense of security in his decisions, ideas, or suggestions because we know its not for selfish gain but rather the benefit of all those involved. This humility and character simply reinforce his leadership abilities.. The last of Josh's strengths I would like to highlight is his conviction. Conviction can relate to multiple aspects. There can be religious, financial, ethical, etc. The previous story references his ethical convictions in not pushing his own benefit or agenda. This third and final story will shine light on his religious and financial convictions. I have been able to observe this aspect of Josh because we both share similar spiritual and religious convictions. Josh's spiritual convictions guide his moral compass. These convictions provide a foundations for decisions, actions, and motives. Him sticking to these convictions keeps him anchored and he can remain stable in times of uncertainty because he remains tethered to what he has chosen to believe. This is extremely important in leadership because when others doubt or don't understand, he stays grounded to reality and does not panic. Financial conviction is just as real because it takes the focus off the immediate present and looks at the big picture. Delayed gratification, according to the study Stanford did years ago with the marshmallow test, is an indicator of success. The ability for oneself to refuse immediate gratification in order to gain more in the future is an uncommon quality. Josh possesses this quality. Without getting into monetary specifics, it was evident that he and his wife Melodee made the necessary sacrifices to ensure better financial security in their future. This aspect of financial conviction shares similarities with the aforementioned religious conviction in the sense that both show that he has the ability to make tough and sometimes unpopular decisions.. Josh showed great leadership right away at the Assemblies of God Credit Union. He quickly became the go-to guy for anything I.T. related and always did his work with excellence.. Josh took our oldest branch and did a wiring make-over that took weeks. It is now clean and the cables are easy to identify.. Josh always had a smile on his face and was always ready to help. He is very strong with customer service.. My wife and I have been good friends with Josh and his wife for many years now. Many times throughout the year we get together for events and hangouts. One thing that I always admired about Josh is every time the party was over he always stayed to clean up. No matter if it was at his house, or another place. He would help with whatever needed to take stress off the host and the house the party took place at.. My wife was an employee of Josh when he was the Admissions Director at Evangel University. She loved working for Josh because he was such a loving and caring boss. Always looking out for his employees first. One thing I always remember her saying is he was the hardest worker. He never asked his employees to do something he wouldn't do or had already done. He was the first one in the office and the last one to leave. I know for a fact Josh was well underpaid in this position but that didn't stop him from putting in 60+ hours a week and never complaining.. As we all know Josh was sent home from Officer Training School his first time. One thing that I admired about Josh when he came back is he owned it. He didn't make up a story or try to come up with an excuse of why he was sent home. He told his close friends and family that he had failed his PT test. From that moment forward Josh was determined to get back tot he Air Force and prove that he belonged. I saw his dedication and perseverance in this time. While many people would have quit and gave up, he never once thought about it. That's how Josh is though, he's a fighter. There was no doubt he would get back and he did.. I have had the pleasure of knowing Joshua for the past 9 years and have had the pleasure of watching him grow. There are many qualities in Josh but if I had to narrow them down it would he his hard work ethic and ability to lead others to work. I was his leader for many years and if I needed something to be done efficiently and get others to buy into the task, I’d ask Josh to lead the team. On one specific occasion, our group was going camping and Josh was one of the only ones with camping experience, so I ask to go first and survey our site, pick and choose and adequate site, then set camp. He was able to create a team, lead them, survey the land, set up camp for about thirty individuals and when I arrived the food was already prepared.. As Josh grew in our youth group he quickly became a leader and sought out ways to help impact others. On a specific occasion, there was a young man who was considered “difficult” and many of the other youth kept their distance. Josh was able to be persistent in this young man's life and eventually broke through to this individual and befriended him, soon after that the “difficult” member became a hardworking, pleasant individual. I attest this 180-degree change because of Josh's compassion and persistence.. Joshua’s life was always marked by his very noticeable qualities, he was always consistent, hard working, diligent and friendly. As his leader, Josh was my right-hand man whenever I need help with anything I knew I could call him at any hour and he would help. At one point I had taken on a renovation project at the church and it entailed a lot more then we expected. I started with a group of helpers, but as the night grew late they slowly left but Josh stayed and worked into the late night, a very physically demanding job and neared complained. That project went on for 4 days and every night we would work very late and he was there assisting. His loyalty is amazing and his work ethic is no longer seen amongst his generation, wherever he goes people rise up to his level by his mere presence.. One of Josh’s best attributes is his ability to build morale in a team. I was fortunate to be a part of the team he took leadership over after 2 previous leaders had left during a high turnover period of time. One of those leaders had been beloved and the other a difficult transition. When Josh began his interim leadership (which turned into permanent leadership) of the team, he built a morale stronger than either of the two leaders before. He was able to manage to each team member individually, embracing them for their different personalities, helping them identify their strengths and apply them to their current positions. Although Josh was highly personable and relationally driven as a leader, he never allowed his personal relationships with team members to impact the organization or team’s best interest. For instance, he did not play favorites and he made each team member feel important in their own way. Most definitely, Josh’s interpersonal skills and strong relationship building skills are some of his best traits, which translate into great leadership skills.. As I have worked professionally with Josh and have also developed a close friendship with him, I have witnessed both his personal and professional life. One of the traits I find amiable is that he never shies away from a problem or challenge. This is likely why he makes such a great IT professional as he enjoys fixing or improving things which are broken or performing in optimum condition. Josh works well in an environment that allows him to build something up to be better than it was before. If he doesn’t know the answer to something, he dives into research to find the right answer or thinks creatively to solve the issue at hand. He is decisive and not one to procrastinate due to uncertainty. He does a great job of balancing his decisiveness with wisdom and enough forethought to make a strong decision. For instance, when there was a moral issue involved in the team I managed under your leadership, Josh, you were able to look at the problem from a pragmatic viewpoint rather than emotional or political. You kept all parties’ viewpoints in mind when trying to help me create a solution. You took into consideration the risk for the organization and the visiting students. You also kept relationships a priority and considered the impact the decision at hand would have on the lives of the students involved. I appreciated your wisdom and ability to create an ideal solution for all involved.. Josh Cincotta is a servant leader. You don’t have to spend much time with him in order to see that. He is confident to take on the fore-runner, spokesperson role when necessary (and does a FANTASTIC job doing so) but is also the individual you will see after the event helping to clean up the coffee, put away power cords, or rearrange furniture. He is the perfect juxtaposition of confident and humble; hard-working yet calm. He gives 110% to the task at hand and the people in his life. He doesn’t make excuses, he doesn’t give up, and he is very loyal. He exudes leadership from his a dedication and focus to whatever task is in front of him, whether that is being a good friend, husband, father, or boss, deescalating conflict in the workplace, or simply doing the grunt work that most people would think was too lowly. He inspires others to follow through his example.. Josh, you have always been a great leader both on and off the field for Ultimate. I think one time that this truly stood out was when all of our players were dropping like flies in the finals of 2008. Zander got hurt, Brian was hurt, Jordan had just gone out and you stepped up big and made sure that the team didn't fall apart. Because of your hard work and belief in our team we won Easterns.. Another word that best describes Josh is focused. When you set your sites on something you get it. The first time you left for the Airforce, things didn't go your way. But Josh stayed focused and worked hard to accomplish his goals of making it the second time.. The best thing about Josh is he knows when to speak and when it's time to listen. I could depend on Josh at every practice to help echo what I wanted when I wanted it. If a player was struggling at practice, Josh would be my eyes and ears and help me get the best out of that player. I have never had a better Captain than Josh Cincotta.",30

I notice amongst this group the heckling amongst each other on certain movements that others struggle with. Everyone in this group was knocking each other down in a fun joking matter except Thom. His ability to take the criticism with a smile and laugh, but instead of joining in on the mockery he encouraged others in the group positively. I remember Thom's ability to brush off the negative comments that were made about him with such GRACE and continue to be the strong positive leader in the class.. We were running the sandbag mile for Veterans day on a very cold day with a very heavy sandbag on our back. Thom did the run himself, but still encouraged others to keep with it while he did it. To finish it he was the only one to run back to the others that had not finished the run to run by there side and help encourage them as they finished. And to do it with such empathy and a big smile of warmth. The look on the others face of such gratitude for him coming back to help them finish the mile was priceless. I kept thinking how attentive he was and empathetic to others even while he was participating in the race.. We were at a birthday party for a good friend to find out that the birthday boy didn't show. He was the first one in the group to offer to drive over to his house to check on him, but to do it very quietly to protect the birthday boys privacy. To find that he wasn't in a good place, he chose to be there to help this person while others were upset with him for not showing to his own birthday party. Thom's ability to distinguish the reason of this other person not coming as not a selfish act but rather than this person wasn't in a great emotional state and needed help. Thom was able to evaluate the situation with great detail, separated his emotions, and maturity to offer this person in need of help the care he needed with the appropriate measures. His quick decision making, and sincerity was again very admirable.. Thom is very selfless and protects his family above all else. Thom was playing professional football in Italy and wasn't due to come home until after the season which was 4 months away. His mother got severely I'll and was in the ICU. Upon learning the situation his mother was in, Thom quit his job and flew home as soon as possible to be at his mother's side, to help her at home and to take care of her while she continued to battle her disease. Thom took it upon himself to protect his mom, ensure she still had a job when she was better, helped her go to the rehab she needed to get stronger and was there for her like no one else was.. Thom is thoughtful, caring, and helpful. I have several stories that support this. One recently was when Thom went out of his way for one of his students’ that was having a hard time at school. The student made some bad choices and was suspended but Thom didn’t judge this student. He opened up his door for the student to have a mentor and role model to help him through a tough time. Even after school was out for the summer, Thom stayed in touch with this student weekly until leaving for the Air Force. Thom made this student a priority in is life which was what he needed when he felt nothing else was going his way. I know the students’ parents, and they were so appreciate of every little thing Thom had done for their son. Thom makes positive differences in the lives of those around him, sometimes he knows it and sometimes he doesn’t. The amazing part is, that Thom does these acts all the time, not for self gratification, but because he is a caring person and wants to help others whenever possible.. Thom is a leader by example even when he doesn’t realize it. At my wedding Thom wanted to do something a special to help us remember our special night. Thom decided to slide across the tables, which was very entertaining. What he didn't realize was that he was a leader for the other 5 guys that joined in and followed him afterwards. Thom is a great leader by example both when he is trying to be and when it is not his main intention. Someone is always watching to learn from him.. Allow me to explain (2) different incidents around football when Thom was playing at Hilliard Davidson HS. Thom was exceptionally talented at football but he was recognized by his coaching staff as an extremely hard worker and leader. Thom is not much into speaking out very often but when he does at times he has a very good point to make. Very often he speaks louder when he does not talk. His actions speak for him. Thom ALWAYS ran onto the field from the locker room for practice and then after practice ran back to the locker room from the field. There was no walking involved ever. My other son played on the same team and heard others from the team speaking out about Thom's ethics. He was respected very much by his teammates from his actions such as this. Hard work and never taking the easy way out prevails. I worked the sidelines during Thom's home football games in high school. I was on the field with no one knowing that Thom was my son because I worked on the visitor's side of the field. There was a particular time in Thom's senior season near the end of a very tightly played football game against an arch rival school that at the time I was standing very close to the visiting coaches. Thom played both ways starting on offense as well as on defense. At this time standing next to the opposing coaches both teams were making changes sending in the offense and the defense coming off for both teams. For whatever reason there seemed to be a longer pause with both teams getting their players onto the field. The only two people standing on the entire football field were my two twin sons Thom being one. It seemed like time had just stopped. There Thom was by himself with his brother. Nobody else at all on the field. It was right then that I heard the head football coach say to his coaching staff ""I wish I just had one player like them two. Real leaders. I know I would win more games."" This particular coach had faced Thom and his brother for three straight years. He had watched Thom play on the field many times and also saw first hand how Thom played the game. No brash talk. No trying to show off or display himself after a great play. He just did his job very well and moved onto the next play. He so very often after a good play would help the opposing player get up from the ground. I knew exactly what that coach was referring too. He was reflecting on Thom's character as much as he was his athletic ability.. Thom worked at a Charter School soon after graduating from Capital University as a teacher there. I thought that things were working well for Thom there. He seemed somewhat happy with working there but after some time he began to share with me some of the things that were going on there. He began to feel that some of he stuff that was going on with the student and teachers were not right. I believe he felt at times that the students were being cheated out of what should be done or taught. Too many shortcuts sort of. Thom began to speak out at times about this to others but I believe he knew that he could not change things. He wanted out instead because his principles were being challenged. He did not share the same attitude as the other teachers there. He felt what they were doing there was somewhat wrong. So, instead of just going with the system there he chose to leave. I definitely do not know all the facts of what was going on in that school but you so often do hear about certain businesses where the practices are not ethical. Many employees still stay with those companies even though they know of certain bad things going down. They don't speak out for fear of losing their job either. I might be wrong here but I do believe that Thom's belief's on what should be done and what is the right thing to do at that school meant much more to him than just having a teaching position. He spoke up and eventually made the decision to leave that school.. Thom worked at a junior high school in Colorado as a math teacher. He was there for several years. I don't think he had it very easy there because he did not want to go with what everybody else was doing there as a teacher. He did not accept what certain other teachers were allowing to happen. Poor behavior without reprimand. Not doing homework. Not participating or paying attention in class. He had his students pay the consequences which brought wrath from the parents who of course had meetings with the principle. In my opinion he did not want to teach this way letting certain things go on without consequences. I believe he even took some grief from his fellow teachers. I also believe he was not liked by some of his fellow teachers because he wanted to teach the way he believed to be right. Let the children earn their grades versus just passing them along to the next level. Don't ignore things. Do the right thing no matter who likes you or not. I believe this was very hard on Thom but he stuck with his principles. He did not want to be just part of what was going on. It was more important to do what was right instead of being accepted by his peers and do what they were doing.. Befriending those that others have outcasted. Time and time again you have given that person that others have classified as odd, unique and undesired and opportunity to be them. Not an opportunity to ride on your popularity but just to be a soundboard for them. To let them be them and know that what they bring is value. I have envy how you do this so genuinely and watch those folks find themselves and evolve. Thanks for your openness, I wish I could model it.. Your willingness to drop you needs, wants, plans, and routines when it comes to someone who is of need. Most times its doesn't matter how directly connected you are to that person you are willing to give. I can share countless times you have provided this for me. The most recent I can remember is you dropping everything to watch Kyla and Jackson, when neither of us (Jax and I) could. It was a burden that was something you took on positively and making the most of it with and lighting up their night.. The one story I feel most may forget. It's the most obvious. Stepping away from a life that is built around you to giving yourself to a team and organization that secures the freedom of others. AF. I'm proud of you. Wish I had the strength to persevere as you do. To give as you do. You have landed at a place that I feel will amplify your strengths and will spread to those that need your guidance and modelling. I feel it is the best place for your values to spread like wildfire.. Story one about Thom's strength. I might be a little bias when it comes to Thom but I think he is one of the most genuine people that I have ever met. He puts other people in front of himself all the time and loves helping other people out. Thom was playing football in Italy and was getting paid to live and play out there. He was enjoying his time and experience out there playing football, meeting new people and seeing new things. Our Mom had a stroke on Mothers day one year and was induced in a medical coma. Her blood sugar and blood pressure levels we extremely bad and they weren't sure what shape physically she was going to be in when she awoke. They were talking about her having brain damage due to the stroke and the shapes he was in. We shared the news with Thom over the phone and he wanted to see her. Thom was thousands of miles away. He had to make a decision if he wanted to go see Mom. But if he left he wouldn't be able to come back and play football. Part of his contract stated if he left he would forfeit the remaining money he was due and void his contract and time with the team. Thom decided to leave not knowing what condition Mom was going to be in. By Thom leaving the team he forfeited any money he could make and any bonuses he would and could earn. Thom left a lot of money on the table and the opportunity to complete a great experience over seas but he really wanted to see Mom and had to make a tough decision.. Mom ended up coming out of the coma a lot better then expected and was thankfully back on her feet pretty quick. It was heartbreaking to know Thom made that decision and wouldn't be able to go back.. Story number two is a little shorter. Before Thoms Senior year of High School football he broke his right wrist. He was in a lot of pain and needed surgery. He went to the Doctors and they said that he needed surgery and probably screws put in his wrist and they also said that he wouldn't be able to play his senior year of high school football if he had surgery. Thom choose not get surgery and played his senior year. After the season he immediately had surgery and had to get screws placed in his wrist. Just reminded me of him as a kid and he would never go down. Whatever sport we were playing he was always still hanging in there taking a beating from the older kids in the neighborhood.. One of my favorite Thom stories is his second marathon race. Most people don't do one race and trained and ran two. Thom is one of the most athletic people I've ever met. He makes sports look so easy. He trained really hard for the second marathon in hopes to qualify for the Boston Marathon. We picked three spots in the race to cheer him on. The first spot he was making great time and was running with the pace man when he passed us. We moved to our second spot and we were waiting for him based on his pace and time and were expecting him to show up soon. He was a bit behind when we saw him, he stopped and said he had to use the port-a-john. We all laughed and said you stopped and used the restroom. He had to go number two so bad that he stopped and used the Port-a-john. We moved onto our next stop and this time he flew past us way before we expected him based on his pace and was making pace to qualify for the Boston Marathon. We were all so excited that he was running even stronger towards the end then at the beginning. We ran down to meet him at the finish line and ended up finishing well under the qualifying time for the Boston. That blew me away, he stopped to use the restroom and still qualified for the Boston Marathon by plenty of time. When it comes to sports he can compete with almost anyone.. Thom is physically & mentally one of the strongest people I know. I played college football with Thom. Thom played through much pain & injuries & still performed as the best out there. During a Mount Union Raiders game Thom stopped the running back by filling the hole with no fear on 4th down. It was such a big hit. Thom's forehead was cut & bleeding but Thom refused to stay out of the game. His tenacity level is so high.. I worked with Thom at a school that had autistic children. Thom worked hard & was willing to do anything for those kids & his coworkers. He was good with innovative ideas to keep them engaged. I would be his assistant in class & watch how the children listened & respected Thom. Thom would put together lectures &assignments to get the children to better understand. Other teachers would take Thom's work plans because they were so beneficial to the kids.. Thom is a coach for cross fit. He went to a class with my older brother in Ohio. My older brother Mike told me Thom was a machine & was finishing workouts faster than everyone. Then Mike showed me a video of that day. Thom is such a great team player & leader he was handing out high fives to everyone whether the finished or not. He was also pushing others who still did not finish. He totally showed me how to be a leader as a younger brother. He is my greatest role model.. Thom is his family's rock. He has three siblings two of which live in the Columbus area where we grew up. When Thom moved to Colorado to be close to his twin he was still the rock of the family. Everyone turns to him for help when it is needed. When his mom was forced to have surgery he flew in from Colorado to take care of her by himself even when other siblings were here. He stayed and helped take care of her and take her to appointments and helped her get back on her feet. Thom always puts everyone first before him including friends and family.. Thom is one of the most dedicated and hard working people I know. When Thom sets his his mind to something there is nothing that he can't accomplish. Thom is one of the best athletes to come out of our hometown. He never came off the field. He played defense and offense along with return punts for on of the best football teams to come out of Hilliard. Ohio. After high school he went on to follow his dream of playing in college at Capital university. Even with injuries Thom would never leave the field on defense and was one of the star players on the team. When his college career was over he knew he could play at a higher level and wasn't ready to give up which he never does. After attending a professional workout and being told no, he moved onto his next adventure. He decided to follow his passion for the game in Germany, where he went over seas and was one of the best players on his professional team. When Thom truly sets his eyes on something he wants to accomplish he won't let anything stop him from achieving those goals.. Thom is at his best always because he is the most competitive person I have ever met. Some people just always have that competitive edge and it shows in every aspect of their life. I met Thom when we were placed in the same 4th grade class. From the time we were kids until this day he has always had to be the best at everything whether it came natural or he had to work at it. I remember him always being competitive on spellings tests in the 4th grade. He always wanted to compare scores because being competitive is in his DNA. He wants to be the best. Whether a test in elementary school, recess games in middle school, who could jump the highest on his trampoline, who could run the fastest or who could be the strongest. He used to make up games that we would play such as throwing a football up in the air and see who could catch it while making the least amount of noise. Being competitive is who Thom is. He has run marathons(missed qualifying for Boston marathon by 9 seconds in his first try), joined cross fit to compete against others and even coached football when he was done to try and teach our youth this competitive edge. When he was a teacher he would spend hours working outside of school because he wanted to be the best teacher. Thom is the man he is today because he has used his competitiveness in every aspect of his life and it has taken him to great heights.. Leader by Example: I have known Thom for more than 20 years, most of our time together growing up centered around athletics. Thom has a unique ability to get the best out of those around him and to increase the effort his teammates are giving. I witnessed this first hand playing basketball with him in high school, Thom would give100% effort 100% of the time. As his teammate, you had no choice but to match his intensity or you would be exposed. At times, this would irritate teammates but Thom did not care, he was there to do a job and he was going to give everything he had. Thom has a unique ability to lead by example, when he wants the best out of you he does not get loud and in your face, he shows you what it takes with his actions and effort. I did not play football with Thom in high school, but I heard stories from those on the football team that were identical to what we experienced in basketball. Football players were complaining that Thom was giving so much effort during practices and conditioning that it was making the other players look bad. Other players were getting reprimanded by coaches for not giving enough effort compared to Thom. Thom knew that he had to give this kind of effort to get the best out of his teammates in order to achieve their goals.. Humble: Thom is one of the most humble hardest working people I have ever met. The best example I can give of this is very simple. Watching Thom play football in High School and College I was able to see him achieve great success on the field. Playing offense, defense and special teams, he made countless amazing plays, however that in itself is not what impressed me. Thom was the type of player that would score a touchdown and run over and hand the ball to the official, he did not self-promote or celebrate. He would congratulate his teammates and then run back to the huddle, as if to say “we are not done yet, we have more work to do”.. Respected by Peers: Thom is quiet and confident and well respected by his peers. There is not really a specific example I can give to express this other than to say when Thom interacts with people you can tell they respect him. I attribute this to his quiet confidence and work ethic. He is someone that doesn’t say a whole lot, he likes to let his actions speak for him. However, when he does talk people listen, his friends and peers respect him completely and are interested in what he has to say and advice he has to give.. Thom is at his best when he is pushing himself physically and mentally. I use to workout every day first thing in the morning. I wasn’t very consistent. But a few days a week I would roll my ass out of bed and get to the gym by 5:30am or so. Thom worked out at the same gym. And every morning, without fail, he would beat me there. Thom would get there before the workers opened the place, walk in with them, and already have a swim in by the time I got there. It helped me get up each morning knowing that Thom was already in the water by the time my alarm went off. During that period, I watched Thom stack on 20 pounds of muscle in a few months while prepping to play football in Germany. It was impressive.. Thom has shown courage on multiple occasions in making major life changes. I would describe Thom as a pretty conservative guy, and not necessarily as a risk taker. However, on multiple occasions he has taken risks to completely change his life in an effort to have meaningful life experiences. From moving to Germany to play football, to moving to Denver to experience the mountains, to joining the military. Thom has pushed himself to do things that I think go against his more conservative nature. I admire that.. Lastly, Thom and I played lacrosse together for one year in high school. Watching Thom's work ethic in the weight room and running sprints pushed me to work harder than I thought I possibly could. I specifically made it my goal to try and beat Thom in every sprint. I rarely did, but the bar he set forced me to elevate myself considerably.. Thom, What stands out to me is when you helped Kristin and me move across the county without even being asked, you simply offered. This story shows how big your heart is and that you want to see the best for the people around you. You were willing to carry the heavy stuff and load it on the truck, you were willing to stay until that last things were loaded and the house was empty. Then at the new house you helped to unload all the furniture and make sure Kristin and I were safe and sound before you headed on to whatever your next adventure was.. I think our friendship really flourished during ski season. I thoroughly enjoyed our days on the hill. You are such a different skier from our day at Keystone with Kyle and Kristin when we took you back in the Outback to our day crushing Copper Bowl laps, that was a good day. You took on the challenge of skiing more than just boring groomers and now you quite the shredder! Challenge accepted, challenge beat! No challenge is too big for you and that is something to be proud of.. You know I think what has always drawn me to our friendship is just our talks, be it over coffee, beer, in the lodge, on the golf course, on a bus. I enjoy that we talk about meaningful things in life. No chat sticks out to me which speaks to the fact that we have had so many good ones. What I enjoy best is we take similar approaches of listen first, speak second. I think this stands out because of how meaningful they are. I thank you for that, there are not many people that I can have as deep and thoughtful discussions with as I can with you.. Having coached football for the past 27 years, after having played for 12 years, I can without hesitation say that I have NEVER played with or coached a player who consistently exhibited Thom’s qualities of leadership. I have coached players who MIGHT be able to carry themselves at his high level for short durations, but never over the course of time. I mean at all times, never wavering, day after day, year after year. He IS the example and standard I hold my players to even to this day. I am quite certain that players dating back to the year 2001 are tired of hearing Thom Hausler stories. NO player has ever been able to meet these standards and the example he has provided for me as to what I am looking for in my student athletes. If you have been around Thom for any period of time, you will know what I am speaking to. It’s something you almost have to witness for yourself. I am not able to articulate in writing exactly what it is. He exhibits a litany of qualities of which you might find individually in some people, but would only find in total in a very small percentage of people anywhere. We have been fortunate enough to send four football players to the Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs, and one to Army West Point. In my opinion, Thom ranks ahead of any of these young men in the qualities that allowed them admission to the prestigious institutions.. Upon graduation from high school, Thom went on to play college football at Capital University. Knowing many people at Capital, including the head football coach and head men’s and women’s basketball coaches, I was very attune to what Thom was able to do at Capital. I told the head football coach that when Thom arrived at Capital, that he would change the culture of their program. After just one year, Thom's impact became well known among all those I knew at Capital. He led a resurgence in their football program that resulted in multiple playoff appearances. After his four years, the head coach at Capital agreed with my assessment that he, in many ways, was very much responsible for the change in their program. The basketball coaches were well aware of his contributions to not only the football team, but the university as a whole. Thom became the same icon at Capital that he was in high school.. There are many other examples of just how strongly I feel regarding Thom's qualifications for the role he seeks. Again however I don’t think I can do him justice in writing. My trust in Thom and belief in what he offers is literally second to none. There is NO other student, athlete or friend I would put more faith in than Thom Hausler. I would do anything necessary to help Thom...for no other reason other than he has earned my respect and belief in him as a person. I would love the opportunity to speak further with anyone seeking testament to the qualities of what Thom offers.",33

Early on a Sunday morning right after church, Dave drove me and my car full of stuff down to Rutgers and helped me unload everything. This entailed making multiple trips back and forth from the parking lot up a flight of stairs to my room. I didn’t have to carry much, because Dave did most of it. Before leaving, he asked if I needed anything else, then drove my car the 45 minute trip back home. He offered his time with no questions asked and asked for nothing in return.. One summer, Dave just decided to start running - no real former experience at all aside from required running during gym class. He asked me for pointers and he just went with it. I have always had issues staying motivated when it comes to running, but I was extremely impressed Dave stuck with it that summer. He would even run in the middle of the day, on the hottest of days, wearing the same black shorts and purple t-shirt. When he puts his mind to something, he really stays disciplined and committed.. Dave is one of the most dedicated people I know when it comes to his job, and he's always working. As his cousin and next door neighbor, I could see when he was and wasn't home, and if he was home, I could tell if he was still awake because I could see his bedroom light on. During his first year of teaching, I would wake up in the morning and he would already be at work. Late at night, he would still be working on something for school and go to sleep later than I would sometimes. During the summers, he rarely had a free day - he filled his schedule with work at theater camps or conducting for musicals.. The first story I'd like to share is about how we first met. If it were not for Dave's kindness, we would probably not be the greatest of friends that we are today. We were in music school waiting in the hallway for a professor to arrive. I commuted to college and was part of a small freshman group of vocal majors, so my opportunities to befriend other students were limited at the time. I was waiting quietly by myself when Dave invited me to participate in a group conversation. In our first moments, we bonded over our liking of blueberry soda. Dave continued to be a welcoming presence that year which made me feel safe and comfortable to socialize with people I would not have met otherwise. Dave included me in his plans to meet up with friends and go to music performances. As I grew to know Dave over the years, I found his friendship with others extends far and wide. I do not exaggerate when I say that most times we would be out together, Dave was greeted warmly with hugs from people that he knew from various times and places. Whether in his roles as a teacher, colleague, or student, Dave stands out in a crowd both for his excellence and unwavering dedication and support to others. When introduced to his family for the first time, I remember learning that they had been collecting the leftover bread at the local Panera and donating it to the homeless for years. Dave is an automatically caring individual, and I believe the way he encompasses the value of being generous with one's heart, time, and energy is measured by the amount of gratitude, love, and praise I see him receiving back from others. Dave truly treats everyone as thy neighbor, friend, and family.. The second story I would like to share is about a performance we attended together. Our good friend, Francois, was directing the show Miss Saigon. Dave and Francois have worked together as music directors many times in the past, and Dave is often involved in several productions or projects at a time. But on this occasion, Dave was merely an audience member going for entertainment. Throughout the show Dave was the most enthusiastic and complimentary commentator of the cast and their talents, while still maintaining an analytical mind and noticing areas of constructive feedback. One of my favorite qualities about Dave is his ability to balance praise and criticism, and to identify and grow the special features of others. I've seen enough of Dave's work to observe the students and parents being thrilled about their experience with him as a leader, and many of his students have cried upon learning about his departures from various schools or productions. The climax of the narrative in Miss Saigon is a tragic loss in love and death, and then Dave's reaction to the plot. Dave was emphatically moved and allowed his emotions to visibly show through a few tears in his eyes. I've always admired Dave's ability to access his emotions, allow people to see the inevitable vulnerabilities we have as humans, and to challenge the stereotype of masculinity. Dave exemplifies strength by admitting and showing pride in his humanity, and further embodies his nature as a leader by being himself and setting this example for others. I believe this story demonstrates how Dave shows up in all of his experiences as being present, grounded, focused, influential, and dynamic.. The third story I'd like to share is simply a description of a typical meet up I would have with Dave, and one of my favorite stand out nights in our friendship for its simplicity. We met up at a friend's apartment just the three of us, heated some late night frozen food for dinner, caught up on each other's lives, played an iPhone version of the game charades, and watched a comedic movie. I'll never forget how much I laughed that night. It's quite possible that his own laugh and positivity is contagious, but it was instant feel good medicine for me. He lent an ear and let me take over most of the conversation that night as I was processing some relationship issues. He lovingly teased my attempts to act out ""break dancing"" or ""folding laundry,"" let me have an extra dumpling and glass of wine, and gave me the larger section of the couch and blanket when it was finally time to fall asleep. Dave knows me so well that through his humor he can help me accept and laugh at myself, enjoy the present moments, and let go and be goofy when needed.. It is with delight that I share my stories about David Regner's strengths as I have come to know him over the last eighteen months. This year, he came to me with an idea of having my high school mixed chorus sing with his ninth grade band. It was an exciting proposition for me because my chorus is a non-audition group and the opportunity to sing with a ""live band"" seemed like a lifelong memory builder for my students. David was very relaxed about connecting the two for an after school rehearsal and led the way, combining over one hundred and fifty students. He chose a piece with a dramatic ending that I knew would excite my students, who generally take chorus for an arts credit. His entertaining manner with a loving firmness came into play throughout their first run-through together. My students immediately adored him and were highly impressed with his beautiful tenor which he demonstrated several times. My students were extremely uplifted before and after this performance in front of their parents and peers. It was such a great thought and great choice for David to think of adding my group with his. Many students said their parents found it to be their favorite number on the concert and added that they would ""always remember this!""David is incredibly welcoming and warm with a playful sense of humor and my students immediately recognized this!. Earlier this year, David encountered an unusual situation for a young teacher that could be deemed highly stressful and he handled it with intelligence, calm and grace. He happened to walk into my chorus rehearsal room one afternoon around 4 pm, long after classes had ended. For some reason, the door had been left unlocked that day and when David entered, he encountered two young teenagers, mostly undressed in an extremely ""compromising"" position. As David would, he kept the obvious embarrassment of the situation at a level of calm, questioned the students (who lied about what he could clearly see was happening) and handled it like a professional who might have been on the job for decades. He brought the students to administration, who handled it with phone calls to the parents and subsequent meetings with both David and the students. Although it was a highly charged situation, David's clarity in the moment, his sensitivity and his strength of character allowed him to professionally handle this. I was highly impressed with his actions when he shared this with members of our music faculty.. In our Arlington music department, there are concerts happening on a continual basis throughout the year. And with each and every concert in both the orchestral and choral concerts, there is a program. Having had to do this on my own for numerous years before joining the Arlington music faculty, I can assure you that it is more fun to crawl half a mile on your knees than prepare and print hundreds of concert programs. Yet, David did this for all of our concerts. Yes, we provided the information, but there were always edits that had to be made, names that needed to be changed last minute and he did it all, including the dreaded formatting. I was always amazed at how he kept his sense of humor and calm while agreeing to do this, on top of his full teaching load every day. It seemed easy for him to find students to proof read and fold them all, because they adored him. He will be sorely missed in our music office this year. Not just because we now have to format and print our own programs (teasing...), but because David's joyful nature, sense of humor and true love for those around him and the character to always lift others up, will be missing.. I can recall several times when David and I would be talking about varied aspect of what we were doing at Arlington HS (band directing, literature selection, rehearsal techniques), and regardless of the topic, David was always interested in learning more about whatever it was we were talking about. Even if it was something he was very familiar with, he was engaged, enthusiastic and eager to know more by the end of the conversation than he did at the start. His exuberance for just about everything we did together was energizing, motivating, and contagious. He made you want to talk more about the topic and get better at it yourself. His positive energy was infectious and quite enjoyable.. I've watched David rehearse his bands many, many times. Probably more than he would care to know! However, he was always open to the feedback I would offer him and always eager to grow from the experience. What I was most impressed with, however, was the passion, energy and enthusiasm he would give to his kids. Every time he worked with whatever ensemble he would be working with, he would always, without question, give 100% and insist on nothing less from his students in return. I learned so much from watching him share his passion and knowledge with his students. He is a very special musician, teacher, and human being.. David was never too proud or confident to ask for advice. This has served him every well as a young teacher. Whenever there was a situation in which he was not sure of what to do, he would ask for advice or assistance. He had a large department with many different personalities and knowledge bases to seek advice from. He always seemed to know which person to go to about whatever matter fit that particular person's experience. Additionally, his ability to network and make connections with people is something that is really a gift for him. These are not superficial connections either. These are connections that have purpose, sincerity, and depth. On a more personal note, David and I had been talking for a while about my desire to get in better shape and lose weight. After a recent doctor's visit, when finally realized I needed to do something about it, David insisted he was going to help. He said ""we are going to work out together and I am going to help you and you are going to help me"". He then took it upon himself to purchase a gym membership that offers guest passes, and he did this so I could start working out with him. He was insistent(politely) on asking when we were going to start and what times we would go, and our journey began. 16 weeks later, we had worked out together as many as 3 - 4times per week, we were at the end of the school year and I had lost 20 pounds of the 50 pound goal I've set. Now, almost a month later, I have my own gym membership now, I've lost 2 more pounds, and I am working out 5 days per week. He was the help I needed to get things started and I will not look back. I truly appreciate what he did for me. His friendship is one I will always cherish and I hope will continue. Thank you, David!. In the fall of 2014, David Regner joined the distinguished music faculty at the Arlington High School in Lagrangeville, NY. After our first round of concerts, David noticed that we needed a more professional program book for our 4 Winter Concerts and 4 Spring Concerts. He offered to formant and put the programs together for us and from then on at concert times, David would email us (6 other music directors)and remind us to submit our programs and program notes for our respective groups. This took many, many hours that he was not in any way required to put in, but he did it in addition to preparing his own bands to perform. This generous act of his, singlehandedly raised the level of the presentation of our concerts to meet the quality and caliber of the performance level.. All of David Regner’s students loved and respected him! He earned this admiration because he cared so much about them while demanding so much of them. He would stay after school most days to give extra help lessons or make up lessons. In addition to being the director of one of the all freshman bands and a concert band, David agreed to lead the 2nd and 3rd level extra curricular Jazz Bands without compensation. These bands were auditioned for after school by him and each band rehearsed once a week in the after school or evening hours throughout most of the year. He took the 2nd level to the Berkeley Jazz Competition in Boston and brought Jazz 3 to the Music in the Parks Festival. he also had both Jazz bands perform in the annual Jazz Cabaret at Arlington High School. The bands were fantastic under his direction and it’s just amazing how much time, talent and love he gave to these groups again, without monetary compensation.. David Regner at his last concert took the time to address each of his colleagues from the stage to say a “proper” goodbye. He had taken the time to write down many qualities he loved about us, things he had learned from us and things he would miss about us. He addressed us one by one and I know that I was reduced to tears, the moment he shared about me. David is such a caring, loving and giving human being. He is the one that is TOTALLY going to be missed!. As one of David’s close colleagues in a group of graduate conducting students at Northwestern University, I found myself alongside David for many tense, high pressure, and stressful situations. Many people in such an environment become competitive and closed-off, doing all they can to preserve their own position and standing. But for David, it always seemed that his natural instinct was to act in the opposite fashion. Rather than close himself off or create distance during tense moments, David always appeared eager to listen to and connect with his colleagues(including me) and to support them unwaveringly. He always displayed the utmost loyalty and generosity of spirit; David does not just see “the glass” as half-full, but he ""fills the glasses” of everyone around him, as well. And when the energy of the team became dark or heavy or negative, it was always David who never failed to provide relief and reinvigoration with his brightness and positivity.. There is no one better than David at delivering genuine, heartfelt compliments and making you feel good about yourself. He is always first to congratulate his friends after their successes, and no matter how big or how small, you feel his sincere love and respect in each comment. David’s consistent self-deprecation and modesty add to the power of his compliments. He exudes a modesty that is endearing and true, choosing to spend his grandest statements in the service of complimenting the work of others, of friends, family and colleagues (colleagues who surely must feel as if they are David’s close friends, as well!).. I had the pleasure of visiting David at the high school where he was a band director in Poughkeepsie, NY. From my earlier experiences watching David as a teacher, I expected that he would surely be an amazing instructor, someone making a strong positive impact on everyone around him. But I was still surprised by the magnitude of his influence on everyone in that community. Walking down the halls alongside David, it was inspiring and invigorating to see the genuine smiles appear on the students’ and colleagues’ faces as they passed him. In his ensemble rehearsals, in front of a large group of more than sixty students, David instantly commanded complete respect and attention while creating an atmosphere that was positive, collegial, and comfortable for all of the different students. As he spoke with student sin one-on-one conversations throughout the day, he treated each young person as a special and important individual. Because of this, each interaction ended with a positive result, with the students knowing that they had truly been heard by someone who cares deeply and has their best interests at heart.. David is able to maintain a high energy level at all times. I can remember numerous evenings when he would be completed exhausted at the end of the day and then recover with a meal and then be able to run rehearsals for hours through the evening. Whether was 0800 or 1600, David acted like that moment was the best time of day!. David is incredibly inquisitive. I ate numerous meals with David or the last 4 years. Every meal was a chance to learn and grow. I remember the questions. Many times, these were about work, but many times about current events or the nuts a bolts of life in the area. He is always soaking up new information!!. David is willing to try new things, outside his comfort zone. I ask him to take over a percussion ensemble with our Marching Band. He said sure and never looked back. He brought what he knew to the table and then learned as he went. Creating an upbeat atmosphere with the kids and other staff, within no time he was working the group like a season expert in the field! Always ready to help, always ready to grow!. When I reflect on times we shared at AHS, one of my favorite was sharing the piano bench with you when we performed Ritmo. When I asked you if you wanted to do the piece with me (and Concert Choir), you, in your never ending enthusiasm, of course said, ""yes."" I know the amount of practicing you put into the piece, and your energy and wonderful personality just added to the fun. Your demeanor is quite simply infectious, and it spread throughout the choir. They totally enjoyed having you a part of their experience, I think as much as I did. I'm only sorry I didn't program more double handed pieces to perform with you!!. My second recollection has to do with Admiral Players and conducting the pit for All Shook Up. I'm honestly so glad you decided to get involved with AP and I'd like to share my reasons. First of all, I knew how much community theatre you've done, and I knew you had done this show too. It was a perfect transition for you, and it pushed me to finally accept the role as vocal director, for which I am truly grateful for to you. For this show and for Forum, I could see the enjoyment the pit musicians had working with you. They simply loved you, chili and all!!! They had the amazing experience of being under your baton, and it was just wonderful to watch them as they enjoyed your reactions to the actors.. My final thoughts are about what a helpful and supportive colleague you are.1) When I had a piece that I needed help with on the Filipino pronunciation (Rosas Pandan), you mentioned that your mother spoke the language fluently and volunteered to take it to her for help. You recorded her speaking the text, and brought that to me so I in turn could help my students.2) You took on the huge task of organizing the concert programs. I know I speak for the entire department as I tell you that we were so appreciative of your willingness to do this for ALL of us. I believe you simply volunteered to take on this task, and the result was a beautiful program for each of our concerts. I don't know who is going to take over that job!3) You were ""assigned,"" I think because you were the new kid on the block and no one else wanted the job, the duty of collecting from each of us and paying the waterman. Not once did you ever complain about doing any of these tasks.4) And finally, I also know how helpful you always were when it came to technology. How many times were you asked to help with something computer related? You always found the time to help all of us, and always did it with a smile. The willingness and availability you made of yourself really set you apart. Your sense of humor (we all love your laugh!!!) and professionalism are exceptional. Your musicianship and professionalism is unquestioning, and you combine it with such warmth and fun. In speaking personally, you were always there with a hug and kind words for me, and I truly appreciated your friendship. Not once did you ever make me feel that I was imposing on you. I have often said, ""David is the one person in the department whom EVERYONE truly likes!"". The past 3 years have been tough for me. Without getting into details, in December2014, I felt lost...I felt stupid for not knowing what was really happening in my life...and I felt so scared. Of course, my children probably could sense my fear. And I’m sure my parents and brothers could sense it too. But now that I know more about family dynamics, I think it goes a step beyond that. I think my family not only sensed fear...but they felt fear themselves. And, yet, with only the grace that my brother has, David came and stayed with me that whole first week. He built fortresses with my children out of giant Legos. He checked up on me at dawn when my cousin texted him that I was crying. And he ate meals with me...one that comes to mind was boiled gnocchi from Trader Joe’s that I just poured microwaved tomato sauce over...mmmmm =)But one moment will forever stick with me. He and I were sitting on the couch while my daughter was playing an educational game (how educational? you will see from the following sentence that it’s questionable). And I remember that after the iPad's monotonous and robotic voice said “The – banana – is – yellow,” Kacey said out loud but in a whisper, “I knew it...” And David and I did what we do so often when we're together – gave each other a look and laughed real well. I love those times. And the reason why that memory is special is because, wouldn't you know, it was the very first time I laughed after my world fell apart. The very first. And it is so fitting that the person who helped me do that was my brother Dave. He helped me not lose who I was, and I believe it is because he doesn’t lose who he is. That’s the underlying message to this story. I know that David sometimes says he changes a bit based on who he is surrounded by – we all do. But I’ve watched David grow up. And I know, despite what others have tried to do, he is true to his character. He respects himself enough to be himself. And I wish I could be more like that.. David must have been only a Junior in high school. I drove to the Bronx to work all day and night for a special event I was coordinating for World Vision. And as I was just about to get onto the highway to head back home to NJ, I got a flat tire. It was almost dark, I was in the Bronx, and I had to wait hours for my dad to arrive and help me. Today, people could have easily passed the time by using their smartphones –checking e-mail, watching videos, and even shopping online. But this was 2005, and the iPhone didn’t exist yet. So, I did what few people do now -- I used my phone to call people. I'm sure I made many phone calls during those hours, but the only person I specifically remember calling was my “Lil Bro #1.” Looking back, he was so young. He didn’t even know how to drive yet! And, yet, that day he took on the “older brother” role and listened to his silly sister ramble on and on. As I’m writing, this story means even more to me today because, 12 years later, I still use my phone to call Dave. And, luckily for me, he uses the phone to call me. In a world where conversation is substituted with Facebook, tweets, and texts, picking up the phone to make or receive a call takes skills...or should I say courage. And courage is something that my brother certainly has.... I just celebrated my 34th birthday. And I can remember that exactly 1 decade ago, my 24th birthday was the worst birthday I ever had – and it still is to this day.7/27/2007 was 2 months after I moved to California where I didn’t know a single person. My husband had to work on my birthday (as he did pretty much every day working 70-80 hrs/wk). And I spent that day getting my oil changed with my in-laws who drove up to keep me company. And what made it worst was my brother Dave and my cousin Dana kept telling me about this awesome movie that they knew I’d love called Hairspray. So I asked my husband to watch a late showing of it after work. And what did he do? He fell asleep during the movie, and I ended up crying afterwards. So I remember the next day, feeling so alone in this weird town called Sacramento, I get this package from NJ. And in it is a “California Survival Kit” from David and Dana=)In it was this long note from Dave in his trademark script handwriting describing all the thought that went into the Hollywood star with my name on it, the “How to Survive an Earthquake for Dummies” booklet, the inflatable floaties for when California would break off from the rest of the continental United States. And, oh, my favorite, wallet sized and 5x7 sized pictures of the current governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. To this day, it’s still one of the most meaningful presents I’ve ever gotten. That’s the thing about David. He has been kind to me even though it wasn’t always reciprocated(for 14 years...I’m so sorry...). And I’m so thankful for that. I personally know of siblings who couldn’t care less about their other siblings. And, in a way, I feel like I deserve that from how I treated David. Yet, here is he sending me care packages, listening to me yap on the phone, and being there for me in everyway after my world fell apart. David, thank you. You are such a gift to me. And you’re a gift to Jeremy, Kacey, and Jeremiah. I miss you, and I really wish you were there on my birthday so we could laugh like we always do. Or so that we could talk one on one in the office and be real like we also do. You're not alone over there. You may have angels, you have a God, and you have us here rooting for you! You going out there took courage over your fears and respect for who you are. And, truly regardless of what happens, you and God are writing a wonderful story for you! Love always, your sis Noelle. David’s “Lola” (grandmother) was visiting from the Philippines when David was in grade school. We were on a trip together with all the other grandchildren. As the kids happily chatted and skipped along as we walked towards our destination, David slowed his pace so he could wait and help his Lola who was walking slower and lagging behind everyone else. David was such a caring and thoughtful boy. Another instance which illustrates this was when I was about to get a speeding ticket. David was in the car with me as I tried to reason with the police officer that I shouldn't get the ticket because I was following 3 other cars which were going at the same speed as I was; that the 25 Mile/hour flashing sign was already off because school hours had resumed. David did not want me to get into trouble arguing with the cop so he offered to give me his $80 that had taken him so long to save. I didn't think he would make good on that but when I took him up on his offer, he willingly gave that up for me.. One of our nieces recently got married. David was asked to be one of the musicians to play at the wedding ceremony. For reasons not fully known to me, David had expressed that he did not feel comfortable taking the over one hour long drive to the venue with the other main musician at the wedding. But we did not have that many options. And so David agreed to drive the other person, and practice/collaborate with him on the pieces they had to play. They not only played well together but I saw them seemingly enjoying the wedding, too. This shows some degree of emotional maturity: to acknowledge negative emotions and yet be able to set it aside to work towards a common goal. And who knows, perhaps as he worked with the other person, realize that what he felt or that the other person was not so bad after all. David has displayed the ability to work with people he does not agree with or may not even like, in the many musical shows he has done and other jobs he has taken. That is a strength.. David was in High School when he was asked to be the musical director of a student run play. There were more than enough volunteers for the different instruments needed but they needed a good piano player. Knowing that the piano part had complicated parts, he asked some students whom he knew played the piano really well. Each of them would take the piano book home, practice the pieces, but eventually, each of them would return the book to him and tell him the parts were too hard to do given the time they had allotted to master them. With only a few weeks left to rehearse and desperate, David took the piano book, studied the parts where the piano would stand out, practiced and ended up playing the piano and conducting the play at the same time. Maybe not perfectly (although my untrained ears could not tell), but well enough to make the play a success! David was able to take a problem, find a solution and give it his best. For someone who once told me I did not teach him to “fail well”, he is someone who is willing to take risks, put himself out there and accept the results knowing that he did the best he could. That requires courage and strength.. This story happened when David was in High School. There was a Music Teachers' Workshop being conducted at the West Orange High School where a guest conductor was giving pointers on conducting to a group of music teachers in the school district. David, for some reason, was one of the students allowed in that workshop. At one point during the workshop, the guest conductor asked if any of the participants at the workshop would volunteer to conduct a music piece. I’m not sure if any of the teachers volunteered. But when there was an awkward silence/hesitation, David slowly raised his hand and came forward. He listened and learned from the guest conductor who supposedly told him he had the talent in conducting. After that workshop, David’s orchestra teacher asked him to conduct one of their pieces at their next concert. I was so proud to watch him conduct that piece, and the audience must have loved it as much because they gave him a standing ovation! This shows David not only has the musical talent God gave him, but the courage to try things even when he is unsure of the results. David has been the Musical Director in so many plays for so many years in different towns. He works with adults and children of so many ages and from so many different backgrounds. And after a few short weeks, they are able to perform a show that is enjoyed by so many people. This shows David’s ability to work with people, harness their talents and bring them together to work towards a goal.. I call David our “Truck Driver”. He went to school at Northwestern University in Illinois. He had to drive back and forth to and from our home in New Jersey even during winter, as he juggled his seemingly always busy schedule packed with deadlines and commitments. I have traveled that same route several times and I know it requires stamina. I am also reminded of one summer when David stayed with us after he had already graduated from college. He would wake up so early so he could go and work at a children’s musical summer camp. Then he would go straight from the camp and go to rehearse another group for a musical play. On days he would not be rehearsing, he would drive to private students he gave private lessons to. He even subbed as a university teacher! And he did this all summer long. Even under pressure, David can calmly take on a task when he sets his mind to it, and do it well. He is not afraid of hard work.. One of things I always admired about David was his work ethic. He was always known for his talents with music but one particular summer I remember David made it a goal for himself to get in shape physically. Multiple days a week he would run and do calisthenics. Even when it was extremely hot outside, he made sure to complete his workout. Sometimes he would ask me for advice regarding some physical movements. Not only did this show that he was serious about getting in shape but he was also humble enough to ask for help. That summer David impressed me and other family members. Out of all the siblings, David was the only one who did not compete in high school athletics but that summer, he was the most athletic. Once David sets a goal for himself, he usually accomplishes it.. David and I had our share of battles and fights growing up. I certainly called him names that were untrue and hurtful. But when I was in 8th grade, David invited me to a video game tournament with his friends. This was probably at the peak of my immaturity and David still invited me to hang out with him. Not to brag but the highlight of that day was probably when I beat the best player there, something that David's friends years later actually still remembered. David ended up winning that tournament (although technically he broke a rule that should have had him removed from the tournament, it was a stupid rule anyway...they said he can't switch characters even though his specific character could) but what I remembered most from that day was the fact that he invited me...and that he shared with me some of his winnings. He was proud of me and I was proud of him. Thanks for inviting me to that tournament, bro.. I forget if I was in 5th grade or in middle school but for some reason I needed to cook egg rolls for school. My mother makes the best egg rolls, everyone in our extended family knows it. My mother was trying to show me how to prepare these egg rolls the night before I needed to bring them into school. We were upstairs and as she was trying to teach me I did/said something to her that made her upset. She ended up leaving and telling me to do it myself. Knowing me I probably cut her off talking, saying ""I know!"" or something. As she was downstairs, David volunteered to help me with the egg rolls without my mother knowing. We both began rolling the egg rolls, they were probably really bad. I specifically remember my mom walking back upstairs and David rushing to finish one last egg roll and then went back to pretending he wasn't helping me. He was looking out for me but also made it a goal to not let my mom know.. Rehearsal with NU Symphonic Band This story comes from a few years back so I may have details wrong – but I remember well the impression I had of these rehearsals. David was slated to conduct a suite of mvts of Malcolm Arnold. I believe it was in his second year of graduate work at Northwestern. David by this time in his study had gained a good bit of confidence and was comfortable leading rehearsals. This piece was a much longer piece and bigger portion of a concert program than anything he had done in grad school before. I recall some anxiety on his part about the pieces or the length of rehearsal but David (as he is wont to do) really dug in on his preparation and made sure he had all the tools he needed to really rehearse compellingly. By the time we got to rehearsals of the piece, I remember David being so caught up in what he wanted FOR the piece that he was able to really lead rehearsals in a compelling and fast-paced manner. I remember how decisive he was on the podium, how animated (in the service of the piece) he was when describing what the players needed to do. His rehearsals were incisive, accurate and lightning-fast in pace. The players loved them. I remember noticing how his confidence seemed to come not just from his knowledge that he “was ready” but mainly because he knew he was serving the players, the music and the composer. It was tremendous to watch.. As David was completing his MM – I recall spending a lot of time on his search for a job. It was one of the few areas that David was less than comfortable presenting his skills and really advocating for what he wanted. What I remember of the process is that I was impressed NOT with David’s raw skills and natural aptitude (aspects of him that USUALLY jump out to me). Instead I was impressed with his ability to seek out help, to ask questions, and to really be open to new demands on him (many that made him uncomfortable).We spent a lot of time working on interview strategies and David was able to incorporate new skills, ask questions that would lead him to new insights and push him beyond his current level of comfort. What struck me the most about the situation was how much David’s HUMILITY really served him well. He is a tremendously talented person and one who experiences a lot of success (often quickly). I was touched to see how that did not get in his way when humility was the tool that he needed to serve him at that time. He was able to let himself be taught without ego or excessive ""self-critique"" and simply let himself listen and then change. I was very proud of him.. Back in undergrad, I remember walking around campus with you David and with other friends. Sometimes this was to go to the dining hall or to the Newman apartments. I think this specific time that I remember was when a group of us were walking towards the dining hall and as we walked, our conversation would be interrupted as people you knew passed by. You would immediately share a friendly greeting and even a hug to each person. From this moment on, we would poke fun at you that you literally knew 1 out of every 5 people on the Rutgers campus and that you would share a hug with a least half of them. While most attribute this to popularity, and that would be our running joke, I think it’s really a tribute to your open personality and friendship skills. It’s clear that you know so many people not because of fame, but because you are open to meeting new people, making new friends, including people who are not yet your friends into you group of friends. If I think back correctly, that’s exactly how we became friends in the first place.. My life is two things: teaching music and musical theatre. And while I was involved in musical theatre in high school, I never really got back into it in college. That being said, musical theatre is my life now and I think I owe it to two people. One is my coop teacher Marie Malara who started using me as her pianist for various choral and theater gigs. The second is you. I remember the first time I stepped into the Villagers Theatre was to see a show you music directed, Pippin (It was also the first show I saw Corey direct it but that’s a different story). I thoroughly enjoyed. Later that year, you recommended that I tryout for 42nd Street, another show you were music directing. Hot mess that I am, I still managed to obtain the role of ... Oscar the rehearsal pianist. And that was my first step into musical theatre. Even later that year, you recommended me to Donna to take over your position at the Villagers as music director of MMM. A job that practically fell into my lap and a job I continue to work in till this day. And while I know grad school brought you to this decision to leave, you could have easily just left Donna to find her own music director. Instead you chose to recommend me. From recommending me to people you knew in the musical theatre world, to hiring me to play in your pits and introducing me to even more people, half the people I know are because you made those connections for me and because you pulled me into this musical theatre world. I don’t know if this is really a story about you or a story about me but I think it definitely highlights your caring nature and selflessness.. It’s so clear how passionate you are about music and musical theatre. If I could remember all the times you surprised others and me with your presence at one of our shows, I would right a more specific story. But I constantly think about how your passion for teaching at the high school level brought you more than 2 hours away from us to work in Poughkeepsie and how this distance did not stop you from either coming to visit or even music direct shows in our area commuting over 2 hours close to everyday a week in some cases. I look back on our Teensvill shows and on A Chorus Line at the Villager’s Theatre and think, why would he do this to himself? How can he possibly do this? It’s so clear how much you love the communities you work with and the things that you do to make sacrifices outside of the actual work like commuting from Poughkeepsie to be present and to support all the communities in your life",41

I don’t know if Katie has mentioned the fact that I’m doing one extra rep in each exercise. I do this just because I can’t do anything else to help you. When I got the e-mail from your training facility to write 3 stories, I was delighted and tickled to help. I guess the first trait or strength that is very obvious is that you’re a very hard worker. My ass was usually dragging when we were working together on the basement, upstairs or playground. On the upstairs and basement you would always say “it’s just 9:00, what’s the problem.” We didn’t let any grass grow under our feet on the upstairs – that I know for sure. The best example is the playground. We knocked that out of the park. We dismantled it, power washed it and had it reassembled the next day. I think we built the entire playground in a week. But nothing takes the cake like mulch day. We were all done for the day. Then at2:00 on that Sunday afternoon, you found the mulch you wanted. We worked our asses off that day. I don’t know how many trips we made in two hours but I was whooped.. EPISODE #2Josh, the instructions to this task were to write three letters about your strengths. I'm going to put three strengths in one letter. Due-Diligence, Persuasiveness and Determination. All great qualities to have. When we first started working on the basement, you wore me out with all the crazy ideas you had. I would go home and tell Terri “there’s something wrong with this kid,” nobody can come up with that many “off-the-wall ideas.” The more we did, the more ideas you had. I had no idea you were researching these things on the Internet. In the basement I don’t know what I dreaded most – the work or the crazy ideas. I think we only moved one wall under the steps, not bad. Upstairs I thought you totally lost it with all of the plank on Allison’s walls. More of that damn computer stuff. The project that impressed me the most was the sandbox that you built in the playground – nice. I'll tell ya I would have told most people to take “a long walk off a short pier.” But no, I hung in there with you. That is why I picked the three traits.1. You did your due-diligence (research).2. You persuaded me to give you your head (which by the way is hard for an old man to do).3. You were determined to make it finish the way you envisioned it. All three projects came out looking great. I’m glad we worked on them together; I hope you feel the same.. EPISODE #3The third letter is about a strength that guys seldom speak of. That is your ability to care. We guys are supposed to be tough, macho, dudes. As time has passed and I watch how you handled different situations, I noticed that is a defining factor in your decision-making process. Numerous times we would stop working and have Katie take a look-see and get her opinion. Another example was at the cookout at your parents’ house just before you left for OCS. Your grandparents were in the sun and you moved the canopy so they wouldn’t have to get up. Time to eat you brought them a table and made sure they had everything they needed. Your dad had trouble with the grill you took care of it. Another example is the engagement ring you gave Katie. You cared about what she wanted. Pretty impressive. I would have never done that. She's my daughter and I know she can be a handful at times. In closing, I just want to pass on a belief that I have and that is that there are only two types of people in this world: “givers” and “takers.” I know which of the two you are. “Givers” care about others. “Takers” do not. Sometimes it’s a lot easier to take than to give but then again you already know that. Take care, See you when you get home.. ALCON, The first occurrence that comes to mind of Cadet Selby's strength in team work....Josh and I are in a newer mission set called contingency response, we have been working together for four years. We often describe our responsibilities in this 10 year old mission set as building the airplane in flight. Along those lines we have conducted a multitude of activities in pursuit of the proper definition of a CR airmen. The one story in particular that stands out in the line of stories I could share, is a day when we took 5 of our teammates on a 6 mile ruck at a local park. This could be easily construed as a normal everyday training op in the ""special"" military mentality and that we should just grit it and go as grunt work --- but as mentioned we are still building our team... In the interest of our mission inside the mission... Josh added anew level of difficulty by picking up a huge log and lining us all up to carry it. He talked about having to work together to accomplish this now more difficult task and staying in step was paramount to mission accomplishment. It was just some gentlemen sweating carrying a log up a hill with 40lbs on their backs, but that day, through action, Josh spoke to our shoulders and our brains defining the apperant term of teamwork and I will never forget his leadership in that simple nudge. I am sure who ever reads this will soon have similar stories to share of Cadet Selby, because leadership is just part of who he is.-CR3. He is a servant leader and offers his services to all of those who he is surrounded by. He usually takes the brunt of the shoulder work and is willing to go the extra mile or speak up in situations that others are not willing to speak up.. He is a fearless leader, which really gets conveyed to anyone who follows him. It is also contagious and shows his followers that he as a leader would not ask anything of his troops in which he would not do himself.. He is a very tactical leader already, which will allow him to build upon all of his future knowledge and opportunities that will make him grow. He has a great organizational knowledge on how the Air Force wing is ran from a mission standpoint.. Joshua had a very rough year in 1996. In January he had broken his leg during a sledding accident. He was off from school for several months. When it was time to go back to school he was very upset because he was still using crutches and thought the other kids would make fun of him. He seemed so down that morning, when I took him to school. We entered his classroom, and the entire class started clapping and yelling because he had returned to school. No sooner that his leg had healed, he had broken it again in October, in a go cart accident. He had many trials with this particular injury. The pain was unbearable at first. After it had healed some the bone had to be broken again due to the bone not healing properly and that started his healing process all over again. He was off from school again for several months. But this time he wasn't worried about going back to school using crutches .As it turned out, his devastating injury allowed him some increased popularity returning to school.. Joshua was in middle school. He had talked some about another boy in his class named Nathan. I even took him to his house and drop him off to play several times. Then the first time I was actually able to meet Nathan, I was a little stunned. Joshua never mentioned to me that his new friend had some disabilities. He had mentioned a few times after that about other children making fun of him. He had also mentioned that he had stood up for his friend. I was so proud of him. Maybe the proudest moment was years later, when I was speaking to Nathan's grandmother. His grandmother told me that having Joshua as a friend had meant so much to her grandson. He had told his grandmother that after Joshua became his friend the other children at school had quit making fun of him. Years later, Joshua was married his best man was his brother Jason, and his only groomsmen was his friend, Nathan.. Joshua was turning 16 and just like every other 16 year old teenager, he couldn't wait to test for his driving permit so that he could begin to drive. I reviewed his efforts and grades at school and felt they were less than par. We had a very difficult conversation when I told him he wasn't attempting the test for his drivers permit until he could show more effort and improve grades at school. The very next report card he not only improved, but landed the A/B Honor Roll. Once he set his mind on that, nothing was going to stop him from earning the right to get his permit.. Joshua Selby story: A couple of years after graduating High school Joshua decided he wanted to join the military and headed out to do so. After starting the process he soon learned that it required physical fitness standards that were more challenging than he thought. It was no time before he changed his eating habits and physical fitness routine dropping several pounds and increasing his fitness level . The next thing we knew he was passing every test with ease and headed to basic training. Over the years that have followed he has participated in several physical challenges including mini marathons, tri-athelons and tough mudder competitions. He has gone to physical fitness level beyond anyone in our families history and enjoys competing with his younger brother even more today than ever.. Hey Babe! I hope all is well with you! I know this is a challenge, but I also know it's nothing you can’t handle. So, I’m to highlight three of your strengths. For the first, I would say reliability. I don’t have just one specific story to back this up, but, I think we both know that you are often the “go to guy” for friends and family. People often come to you for help on projects big and small, advice, or just for company. I believe this is because they know that you will always to what you can to help them. They know you can count on them. Examples of this include helping Bratcher with his landscaping, helping my dad with basically anything he asks for (he often goes to you instead of my brothers because you are always ready and willing to help), helping Scott out with the Peddler, helping your dad with the roof at the lake house, helping Matt with his swing set and garden, and so much more. You’ve helped multiple friends move and given up your weekend days to help. It’s not just the physical stuff either. Often our schedule is bogged down with events because people invite you. Stuff that most people may blow off, you make an effort to attend. Like the time we went to John Hodge’s for the get together and we were the only couple there, joined by Kyle and his lovely girlfriend after you got them to come over. You go out of your way to make sure everyone is having a good time and everyone is taken care of. This is something I hope our children pick up on and realize how valuable this is to others. I can see that many people look up to you and many people are happy to call you friend. I think this was evident at the showing of people at your last flight. Never doubt that you are a good person Joshua, because you very much are.. The second strength I would highlight is your ability to see any situation as doable. When you set your mind to something, you just do it. No matter how big or small. And you never settle. If it’s something you want, you get it. I remember when you asked me to fly down to Puerto Rico when we first started dating. I thought you were crazy! I can’t just up and fly to Puerto Rico. “Why not?” you said. It was just so easy for you to see that there was nothing stopping me. There was no reason not to go. I suppose your qualities of spontaneity and your sense of adventure bleed into that as well. There have been so many times when you have suggested something and in my head I think you’re crazy, but they’ve always worked out. Look at our family car. I never in a million years would have thought we could afford a car like that. You busted your ass scouring the internet to find the car we wanted that was in great shape and within our price range. Now look at us! The perfect family car. Let’s also talk about the improvements you have made around the house. I know my dad tends to worm his way in and help even when it’s not needed. When you two started on the basement, it was the first time you took on a remodel, whereas my dad has done several. Even though you were new to it, it didn’t stop you from getting it done how you wanted it done. You weren’t afraid to voice your opinion, or even step out and do things on your own to get them done how you wanted. It makes me so proud that you didn’t just roll over and do things how you were told. You knew what you wanted and you made it happen. If someone tells you no, you don’t let stop you. Our children are so lucky to have such a strong dad to look up to. Your actions teach them that there is nothing they cannot obtain if they put their minds to it. I have no doubt that they will be nothing short of successful if they have even half your work ethic and determination.. The last strength I would like to highlight is your devotion. This is something I have watched develop since the birth of our daughter. Our family started out rather early in our relationship and we both know it was not something we planned out. No secret. However, there was never a time that you made feel concerned about the partner I was going to raise my baby with. From the get go, you were comforting and ready to take on the adventure. This may have been aided by your ability to take on any situation stone faced and not panic on the outside and I’m sure on the inside there was a bit of apprehensiveness and nervousness, but you never really let that show to me. Whether you meant to or not, you handled it with just what I needed. You were the strength I needed and you haven’t let me down since then. Since that time, I have watched you take on the role as a father and husband and never lookback. I know that we may argue about you going out and me being needy, but I have never doubted your devotion to this family. I know that everything you do, you do it for us and you bust your ass for us in the process. The biggest indicator of this is the reason I am sitting here and writing this letter. You took this position for us. I know that 100%. Even though this is not necessarily the ideal position you saw yourself in, you took it knowing it would be a good position for us. I still worry about you sacrificing for us, but you must know I appreciate everything you do for our family. You are the definition of a proud, devoted husband and father. From the remodelling you’ve done on the house, to the playground in the back yard, to the days you ask to keep Allison home just to spend time with her, to the days you ask me for a to-do list to help me out on your off days, or hell, even the grass. You are completely devoted to making sure your family home is the best looking on the block. I do not doubt that this family is so very important to you and that you would do anything for us. I'm sorry if I have every made you feel inadequate or that you don’t do enough. I couldn't imagine a better partner to raise our babies with. Thank you for loving us and always going above and beyond for us, even if it means making sacrifices of your time with us.. Selby showed excellent time management and prioritization of goals while working three jobs and attending college. Focus on education and completion of his coursework to the best of his ability did not affect his performance at each job in a negative way.. Joshua Selby has competed in numerous endurance races throughout his adult life. His focus on completing all obstacles while motivating his teammates to push through and keep up has been admirable.. Joshua David Selby's focus and determination on any goal he sets is an example to friends and family what perseverance can achieve. His ability to creativity and decisively complete any task or goal is one of his strongest traits and reflects great credit upon himself and his upbringing.",17

We knew we needed to leave. So in order to bring everyone home we had to throw all of our camping gear out . The only person who did not get excited was Cody. He helped throw camping gear etc. away to get us home safe.. Cody's grandparents live in St George Utah, we were on our way there and found out that his grandfather had fell and broke his hip. The only person that could lift him up without his grandfather getting up set was Cody.. While Cody and his sister was home, his sister little girls had swallowed something. His sister panicked because she wasn't able to get it out. She called 911 but Cody stepped in and pulled the object out before the paramedics got there.. My son Cody is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints(Mormons). He study very hard and did all his requirements to receive his Duty to God award. Which is a special accomplishment, which very few people receive.. In Cody's senior year he took auto mechanics. They formed a team for competition which he was the head of the team. They came first in the state of Utah. And took first in the surrounding states and second national. They won a car for the school as well as receiving plaques and awards.. I being a Marine new compass and maps very well. My son Cody wanted to learn, so I taught him and he became very, very good at maps and compass. He would travel through the forest by map and compass. He learned very fast and was very good at it. I am very proud of him!. Well, I'm not sure yet what stories to pick from. But I think the helicopters has to be one of them. It's a great story, but I have to think about how many people would have lost their shit if they would have been in that situation. Or just have not known what to do. You have a calming demeanour when things go wrong, and it helps others stay calm as well. Imagine if that would have been Pernell, Ha!. The day after my mom died, you text me a message on my phone. I don't remember what you said, but it made me feel better if not just for a moment. You are a true wordsmith with putting thoughts on paper, a talent that most people (including myself) do not have.. I hope these stories will help with what you were looking for. I have seen you overcome adversity in so many different ways both personally and professionally. From your cancer to the difficulties you had submitting your OTS package. You have taken everything in stride, and I know you will succeed in your future endeavours. Thank you for being an awesome friend and coworker, I'm excited to see your success in the officer world.. We had gone hiking up in the Uintas with Serina. You kept telling us that it was just over the hill. You were what kept me moving because I thought that we were almost done. Then as we were walking you slowed down and told us to remain calm, look forward and continue walking because there was a mother bear in a den with her cubs. You were so calm and collected about it. You helped me to be calm and encouraged me to keep going even though I really wanted to just sit down and stop moving.. When we were in the hospital room having Trinity I was so tired and kept telling you that I didn't think I could do it anymore. You hugged me and told me that I was strong enough and that you believed in me and that you knew I could do it. You held my hand the entire time and told me what a good job I was doing. You helped me to believe in myself and that I was strong and able.. Some of my favorite memories of you are when you took the kids fishing or hiking. The ones that stand out the most to me is when we went to the waterfall in the Uintas with Elyse and she got tired so you picked her up and put her on your shoulders and carried her the rest of the way. Then when Trin was old enough you did the same with her. Then taking the girls and I fishing at the lake on base at Eielson when we were there the first time. You patiently showed Trin how to get the fishing pole ready, helped her cast, and showed her how to reel in when there was a fish on it.. Your ability to communicate is one of your greatest assets. You are candid and have a wide-breadth of knowledge across many subjects. This enables you to communicate well with subordinates, peers and leadership alike. A particular instance that stands out was a time when you were briefing a General and you impressed him with how you related the tactical mission to the strategic vision effortlessly. You stay up to date in current events and have a personal interest in topics related to your duty. Continue to work on your skills and develop those around you. #talk to me Briggsy. Your Technical degree and personal interest in the subject gives you great strength in your technical knowledge. I saw this on a daily basis in the workplace. Here again you have the ability to influence everyone around you because you have built credibility with your level of knowledge. Young people go to you to learn; your peers seek your counsel; and superior members have actively sought you out to gain your insight. Your team will always be stronger because of your individual knowledge and that which you share with others. #what would Briggsy do. I’ve only got one speed boss! Your attitude exudes confidence and it is contagious. Think back to the greatest TDY ever. You were influential on quite a few folks on that trip, attitude played a big part of that. Your conduct did not create competition, it fuelled everyone’s desire to do more and perform better. It helped us to be unstoppable and irreplaceable. Continue to bring this out in people and find your point man and ensure he conducts himself in a similar manner.#whenyourgoodateveryonesjobyoudowhatyouwant #loveyouBriggsy. First off thank you Cody for asking me to write this and not your downfall because I think it would have been harder to highlight those. During my last TDY I was roommates with Cody. Even though I had met him about 3years earlier all I really knew about him was that he was not a drinker. So knowing this and going into a TDY that was more than likely my last and being an aircraft maintenance norm to party and drink, I was a bit worried about having a non-drinker rooming with me and killing any fun. But that is not how it was at all and he fit right in with the crowd. To me this highlights his ability to adapt to his peers and enjoy his surroundings. Because he did not put himself on the outside he was able to help a lot of us but he got my mind back into fitness and helped me get into a daily routine of working out again. I know he helped more than just me on the trip because we had a van of 7 going to the gym routinely which is almost unheard of during a TDY.. During that same TDY, Cody displayed his ability to think outside the box and lead a team to change a radio and avoid breaking our perfect streak of making sorties happen. Cody is a natural leader and a lot of young airman look up to him. Without question Cody and a few others as well as a young staff went unknowingly against our super to fix this jet and put it in the air. This was a very proud moment for all maintainers as we were close to heading home from a 5 week trip and had not missed a line which is a near impossible accomplishment and I would say 4 out of 5maintainers would not have been able to make this happen.. For the last 3 years there has been no one better for me to seek for advice, whether it is asking how to do a flight control check or how to grow a hydroponic garden. He is an extremely knowledgeable person and is not afraid to pass that down. I know this will continue while he is an officer and he will take the time to teach a struggling young airman how to do something as simple as safety wire a part. I am sure if he has to teach an airman how to do that, he will then continue to train that airmans NCOs as well and probably continues his way up. Continue to be smart and humble Cody and not afraid to step on any toes. Never forget “Specs just do whatever they want”, White Lightning baby!. Highline TrailIn July of 2013, Cody and I set off to hike the Highline Trail, which runs appx 70 miles through the Uintah mountains in Utah. We, mostly Cody, carefully prepared to backpack the trail together; I carried mostly just my personal items as Cody carried ALL of our supplies. We started out mid-morning on a warm day. Cody had his GPS and maps to guide us, but that didn’t stop us from running into a few problems. First, the river had risen to cover the best place to cross, so we spent at least an hour trying to find a place that would not only support our weight, but that we could balance ourselves and all the weight of our packs on. Its important to keep in mind my pack was appx 35lbs, and Cody’s was at least double that. But we trudged on and made it the mountain side where our steep ascent began. It had begun to sprinkle lightly. We had ponchos but not need them as the light rain was warm and felt good as it drizzled upon us. When we reached the top of the peak, there was a cool breeze that was refreshing after what felt like hours walking straight up the mountainside. As we tried to make up for lost time, the rain and the wind got progressively colder. We pulled out ponchos and tried to cover ground but before we knew it the temperature had significantly dropped and a storm was upon us. We were so high up in the mountains we were above the tree line and susceptible to lightning. We no longer had time to make for cover. Cody quickly assessed the surrounding area and found the most suitable spot to set up camp. As he attempted to instruct me to assist in setting the tent he almost got irritated that I could not perform the simple task of holding the pitch until he looked at my hands. “WHAT is wrong with your hands?” he asked. I had no feeling left in my hands; they were beyond cold and there was no color in them either like a corpse. I was a little disoriented at the time all of this was going on. So he took my hands and proceeded to rub them between his and blow warm air into them, just like our father had done when I was little. Once he was satisfied with some returned color in my fingers he set up the tent, alone, in record time and boiled water for me to hold in a canteen to increase warmth and blood flow. It worked. I returned to my old self quickly once dry and warm again. I am very thankful my brother noticed my zombie state and responded quickly. I rather like my fingers attached to my body. On the morning of our third day, I awoke in pain. My feet hurt and Cody could tell from my limping. He asked if it was serious and I said it was just a few blisters. He gave me moleskin and I attended my wounds. As we hiked to the top of another peak, I was getting slower and slower as the pain increased. We broke for lunch on the top of the mountain and he asked me my pain level. I lied and said I didn’t want to quit. I am rather proud of finishing things I set out to do. Cody looked at my feet and at this point they had each become one giant blister. He said he was taking the call out of my hands and that we would hike down the mountain and call for pick up. He said the hike wasn’t worth my feet. I was deeply disappointed in myself, but I knew deep down my ‘little’ brother made the right call. I still feel bad he didn’t get to finish the trail, as I know he would have without me. I hope someday he will.. Father Figure I was 20 years old when my daughter was born; so my brother, Cody, was still in high school and because I was single I moved back in with our parents. We have a small, but close family. Elyse grew seeing Uncle Cody all the time. I have TONS of funny stories, such as while babysitting, Cody took a sharpie and wrote “stinky” on her back with an arrow pointing toward her diaper. Little did he realize my kid was scheduled for a 2 year well child check that afternoon. Let’s just say I looked really stupid! Elyse always looked up to Cody as a father figure. It’s hard to think of just one thing he has done for her over the years. Once Cody joined the military and moved away, Elyse really missed him and her cousins. So she used to spend a month each summer with his family, 2 summers at Edwards and 1 at Eielson. They have always included Elyse in their family activities, whether it be going to the movies, having sleepovers, going to the movies, going fishing, etc. Whenever Elyse was having an issue, and I couldn't get through to her, Cody would make time to talk to her and help her to see right and reason. He has always looked out for my daughter as if she were one of his own. An example of this is another camping trip with our family. I had taken off in car with the little kids and my mother and Cody and my father stayed behind to finish packing up the tents. Elyse, who was around 9 years old at the time, wanted to stay with the boys so we let her. We joke about our family having notoriously bad luck ‘Briggs luck’ and it proved to be no joke as a huge storm started rolling in with lightning in the distance getting closer. And the truck wouldn’t start. Knowing that my elderly father and young daughter could not stay the night without provisions, he ran about 2 miles to the nearest lake hoping there would be help. He found a couple of fisherman packing up and talked them into taking him into the backwoods to jump the truck. Another example is the first Christmas after Cody joined the military. He came home for Christmas and called me on Christmas Eve and asked if there was a toy Elyse wanted that no one had bought. I gave him the description of a doll and to my surprise, he actually found the right one. So that night, after our annual Christmas Eve party, he feigned a reason to go outside. He came in, told us all this story about how he head jingle bells and saw presents fall to the ground with THEIR names anthem. He gave a package to my daughter and his own. I cannot begin to describe the amazement and excitement that came to the kids’ faces when ‘realized’ Santa had dropped packages from his sleigh. It was pretty amazing and unforgettable.. Car Business Ever since Cody was young, he has been gifted with anything mechanical. He was changing the oil in my first car when he was only 14 years old. After that card died, I made the unfortunate decision to buy a Saturn. That car had SO many problems; I used to get stranded because it wouldn’t come out of park, the transmission started to go out. I cannot count the many times Cody came to bail me out. By the time the Saturn was ready to puff its last breath, Cody was a technician at Ford. He told me HE was going to help me get decent car and would use his employee credits to do it. While I was concerned about the color of the car and looking at the cd players (this was a long time ago) he was checking out the car itself to make sure it was good and safe for me and my daughter. He sat with me there all night while they tried to get financing for a single mom. That car lasted me longer than any other car I have had. Until he moved, he took care of oil changes and maintenance. I am not trying to paint Cody as some kind of saint, but when something needs to be done he steps up and makes sure it gets done right. He is hardworking and is happy to help people that are trying to help themselves. Our family has always been able to depend on him. Before Cody joined the military he always had a job and strived to excel. I see SO many men from our generation looking to get something for nothing and I am proud my nieces and nephew have a great example in my brother of how to work. I have seen him stop and help random people staring into their car engines with mystified eyes, helping them (if possible) on their way. My situation has changed, so lucky for Cody, I do not depend on him as heavily as I used to. But I know my father depends on my brother for so much. Cody calls him every week, knowing my father literally sits around waiting for that phone to ring. When it comes to caring for our ageing parents, I know he will be by my side to help out. I am proud of the guy my bratty little brother has grown up to be. My mother wrecked MY car this afternoon. Can you guess who I am calling?. Our first impression of Cody was his get-up-and-go attitude, politeness, intelligence, and eagerness to please. The first time we met Cody was at the airport in Fairbanks, AK. We had just arrived and my daughter and Cody came to pick us up at curbside with our luggage. Before my daughter completely stopped her pickup Cody was jumping out to help us load the suit cases. Many times he would take us around Alaska seeing the sights, fishing, and dinner with his son. As a father figure, I was amazed at how well he interacted with his son never losing patience and fun loving way of communicating whether it was answering his questions or just having fun with his son Levi. He would even stay up late talking about his love of fishing, job in the air force, and all his experiences in Alaska. I was pleasantly surprised to learn while shorthanded at work he was filling in as acting 1st lieutenant even though his rank was Tech Sargent working 12 hour shifts during red flag. Even after long shifts at work we would stay up late into the evening talking he woke early each morning to go work out at the gym before work.. Christmas of 2016 our daughter Sydney and our new son-in-law Cody came to spendtime with us and our family at our home in New Mexico. It was Cody’s first visit andmet the rest of the family. Myself and my wife Karen both noticed how Cody hadconversation and interacted with all the members of the family and friend so well.Our family and friends took an instant liking to Cody and enjoyed his company. Codystruck both of us as super out going person, very knowledgeable about any subjectspoke on and contributed stories similar to our experiences.. The same Christmas trip that Cody and Sydney came to visit us they went to runsome errands in town, driving Sydney’s 1986 Chevy pickup truck. Cody mentionedthe motor was running a bit rough, like its miss firing. So Cody checked spark plugswiring and discovered one the wires has a short and Cody replaced it. We took it for a test drive but it still had an issue with miss firing. Cody removed the air cleaner andvacuum modulator for the secondary’s carburation. More tests were done anddiscovered it was bad. So after having it replaced on the pickup it now runs in topcondition. Cody is very good at diagnosing problems and solving them.. When I first met Cody it was at work. Both being in the military just separate shop. Iwas walking out to the flightline heading through this big heavy door. I yanked on thedoor hard expecting it to be super heavy and practically fell on the man on the otherside (Cody Briggs). He was a larger than life man! Huge is how I can describe it, verymuscular and tall. He looked down at me surprised of course but I took his fascialexpression wrong. He looked at me with an expression on his face of “Puny Humanwhat are you doing in my way” haha. Well he had every right to. After all he was a Staff Sargent and I was just and Airman 1st class. Boy was I scared of him.About a couple weeks later I kept seeing him around giving me the stare down like Iwas in the wrong place. I got up the courage to approach this huge man and ask himwho he was. Who are you and why do you look at me like I am nothing. I was herefirst this is my flightline. I had a bunch of courage. So I walked up to him and said sowho are you? The man sitting next to him says “that’s a Staff Sargent, Airman” and I shot back in a nice way “well I know that, what I mean is are you new? I ran into you the other day and I’m sorry I just wanted to formally introduce myself. I am SydneyStryker. I just wanted to say boy are you huge!!!!!!!” For the first time I saw this manblush and melt like butter. That was the beginning of a glorious friendship thatblossomed into our marriage!My first impression of this man was so wrong. Yes he is tall and muscular and veryintimidating, but the most wonderful person I ever met. There were days when I wentinto work feeling like crud and the day was hard. This man would just smile, ask me how my day was, laugh with me at my reply and all was well in the world. Cody and I would run into one another at work and talk about anything and everything under thesun. What do you think of this? What do you think of that? When Cody walks into a room he has this air about him where everyone will stop what they are doing and justlisten to what he has to say. He can captivate a crowd and have them mesmerized. Weither he is talking about work and teaching airman or just telling a story. He has away with words were he can make even the hardest concept make sense. He canmake you feel better about yourself or what you are doing even on a bad day. He is comforting. On your worst day the man can make you smile with just a look. Thatwas my first impression of my best friend.. My second story about Cody tells you how resilient he is. When Cody was accepted to OTS they gave him orders and a class start date of March 29th. He was preparing to leave by getting all the ducks in a row via selling a house, shipping the car, setting up TMO, and tearing down the garden that just bloomed. Just hours before he was to board the plane to Alabama, AFPC decided to cancel his class because some paper work sat on someone’s desk. Cody was let down hard. He was so excited to leave and start something new. It was a very  irritating andfrustrating experience. He had put so much work into leaving Alaska and getting me set up to handle the small details. After the news Cody found out he need to stay inAlaska for some time. Having already out processed the squadron and all hisqualifications for 7 level Avionics technician archived. He still needed to report towork to iron out the details and prepare to leave again in 3 months. It had taken a month to see if he was still going to have the opportunity to go to OTS still.Cody pushed through the rough time. The air force had gotten his hopes up to startsomething new, a glorious opportunity, a person couldn’t ask for something more! Heworked so hard to get to that point. For that month it felt like it slipped from his hand.But I tell you what, Cody got up every day and went to work. He continued to traincivilian avionics contractors on the F-16 jet. He continued to train on programs in hissection. He even took on flight chief duties for a month. Cody was disappointed inthat month where he didn’t know if he was going to go to OTS or not but hecontinued to work diligently without complaint. Where most would have given up onwork and declined to reenlist Cody pushed through. I and many others have respectfor a man like that. None of us can really know how tough that type of situation mighthave been for him and still have some drive to do a great job every day. I witnessedit first hand and I can honestly tell you that he is the best example of a resilientairman.. My third and final story, the hardest one to write for me. It hard to come up with justone story about how this man did something awesome, where he was at his best. For me describing a part of him is hard to put into words. But today one word came tomind “Grace.” My Husband has Grace.Grace is one of those words all in itself hard to define, so it fit perfectly with mywriting haha. So I searched high and low on the google machine and found a pureopinion column I agree with. And also a Bible verse (New Testament) 2 Corinthians5:21. “Grace means God sending His only son to descend into hell on the cross sothat we guilty ones might be reconciled to God and received into heaven.” I canrelate this to Cody having Grace. He is a Cancer survivor, Put through hell and back.There are many reasons why God wanted to keep Cody on this earth. One of thembeing to teach the rest of us a lesson. Our very lives are a gift with each breath wetake. Don’t waste it by doing harm to yourselves via no eating right, having negativethoughts, and being a waste of space. That was the air I was trying to explain that hegives off every time he comes into a room. People can feel that from him. It’s a perfect harmony. The sun is brighter and happiness is increased. For me it is likebeing washed with pure Joy, Harmony, and excitement. He radiates happiness toothers. Makes you want to be and better person. My Cody is an example of God Grace. The other column I found is opinion but I agree with it. “Grace is the experience ofawe, gratitude, and unconditional love when you are in harmony with yourself andothers and your maker. It is harmonious integration of your body, mind, and spirit. Grace is the spiritual freedom that arises when you realize life is a gift.” CognitiveHarmony was another term this woman used. These are some examples of the wayCody makes me feel when he walks into the room. Especially Cognitive Harmony haha. This is how I know Cody has Grace. All these feelings are put into one word to describe my husband at his best every single day. I Love You Cody.",27

It really showed when he competed for Ironman. He was the most focused person I've ever known during his training. Some days as much as he wanted to give up and skip training, he looked forward to his goal and knew he couldn't quit now. He knew his training was leading up to a bigger goal and if he didn't put the effort into it in training he would eventually pay for it on the day of the race. Every single day he sacrificed his personal/ relaxation time on training and pushing his self harder and harder everyday to achieve his very best. He knew what he was capable of achieving and let nothing get in the way. This is the way Joseph lives his life. He never takes no for an answer and pushes his self and always achieves his goals.. Joseph is such a wonderful Dad. He puts all his time and effort into knowing that his daughter knows she is loved. Before she was born he was so excited for her that he would work all day and night on her room and putting together furniture. He is such a devoted Dad. He always looks to the future and sees how he can improve his self to provide a better life for her and be the best role model for her. He understands the importance in putting in hard work for a bigger outcome/goals in life and he is a leader to her.. Joseph is a very hard worker. In every aspect of his life he gives 210%. In his school he has always been a top performer and gives it his all. In his work he not only has given 10 years of his life to the military but he continues to work hard in his civilian job. He promoted within 4 months of being at Progressive. He received the biggest raise in the state. All of these accomplishments only come from his passion to be the best he can be. He continues to be the best in everything he does. He is the most wonderful husband. He pushes his family to walk in his footsteps and be the best that they can be. He leads by example and it shows in all he does. He never has nor will stay stagnant in any aspect of life. Always looking ahead and looking for ways to improve.. Joseph Clack has impressed me the most with his unrelenting drive for success. During the first year that I met Joseph, 2007, he went jogging with me in my neighborhood. This jog revealed someone that was not conditioned at running. Soon, Joseph became interested in running. That desire in him was impressive with the training he did to become the best at running. He poured over the internet in learning how to get faster times and was on the road or treadmill training to better himself. This intense training led to placing in the upper level with some of the top runners in many run events. He soon qualified and ran in the Boston Marathon with a great finish. In 2016, he placed 2nd in the Blue’s Marathon. The Blue’s Marathon is in Mississippi and has runners from around the world participating in it. His drive is unstoppable.. Going parallel with my first story about Joseph Clack, I would like to share his attention to detail. Because of Joseph, I became interested in training for triathlons. Never in my life have I met someone that knows soo much! In order to win at triathlons, you need to know a lot about swimming, biking, and running. Due to his research and talking with others, he taught me about wattage when training on a tribike, which tri helmets are more aerodynamic, wet suits that are best, and which tribikes are faster. There is a lot more I could add to this list. The amount of technical information he had acquired was impressive!. My third story about Joseph Clack is about how he balances his family life with his many goals. Through all these goals I have seen him partake in, he always includes his wife and daughter. Many leaders will put their family to the side in order to complete tasks. Not Joseph, with all the trips he has taken to better himself at running/triathlons, his family went with him. I have been on many of these trips and witnessed his balance of winning and being a strong supporter of his family. With Progressive Insurance, he was advancing very quickly and receiving many accolades. Even with all the extra work he was doing, he made sure he was there for his family.. My name is Suzanne Parker, and I am the proud mother of Joseph Clack. He is a wonderful son and father to my granddaughter. When Joey's dad and I divorced, Joey, without hesitation, took on taking care of things around the house that needed to be fixed and keeping the yard mowed. I have watched him as a dad. He exemplifies the two things that I believe are the two most important gifts that you can give your child, Godly example and dependability. His daughter knows that her daddy will be there for her. He is an involved father and truly a man of integrity.. Joey has always been financially responsible. He has never spent beyond his means. The interesting thing that I have noticed him doing is that he makes lists of things that he wants to accomplish and the costs they incur. He has strategic plans to reach all of his goals. He doesn't buy or do anything without thinking through every angle.. Joey decided his senior year to start running. The first time he runs he comes flying in the kitchen and falls on the floor breathing hard. I asked him how far he went. He responded with ""about a mile or so."" Since that time, he has run marathons including the Boston Marathon and done Iron Man. He is the most driven person that I have ever known.",9

This has huge benefits for his family and those he works with. I can think of countless times when I have been thankful for this strength but if I had to think of one particular time when this strength was apparent it would be when I was suffering from severe anxiety after my brother passed. His calm disposition was the solid support that I needed at that time. I think this is an invaluable strength because being able to remain calm in stressful situations gives his the ability to concentrate on the task at hand and effectively use the skills he has acquired to deal with the task at hand.. Patrick is an incredible judge of character and is able to deal with all personality types. He has been faced with so many different people and situations and has been able to make the best of each situation and is liked by just about everyone we know. There was a situation at his job that required him to analyze an individual and deal with him in a compassionate but guarded manner. This individual was not mentally stable and had to be dealt with very delicately. Patrick was able to keep a level head and act in a professional manner despite personal attacks and this individuals inappropriate and neurotic behavior. The situation was dealt with and because of Patrick's professional approach he was respected throughout the entire process and supported by those above him.. Patrick has an incredible compassion for everyone and is able to see strengths in people that some others may skip over and not notice. We have an young autistic neighbor and his interactions with her are respectful and he focuses on her strengths and teaches our sons to do the same. This attention to humanity and all it has to offer is an incredibly valuable lesson for the younger generations to not skip over anyone because they may seem a little different than others but instead to find each and everyone's strengths and know that they have something to offer and deserve respect like anyone else.. One of the greatest strengths of Patrick is as a husband. Although I didn’t know Beth through their dating, Patrick was very confident in his relationship with her. He knew that he loved her and was incredibly loyal and caring of Beth. As I celebrated their wedding alongside them and seeing his love for her I knew that this was something that I wanted in my life. When Patrick and Beth moved to Lincoln to study at the University of Nebraska I was very glad to get to know Beth better. I saw Patrick care for her in the transition to a city far away from Beth’s family. One night when Beth was having a particularly rough time transitioning Patrick carefully and politely asked for me to leave. I enjoyed hanging out late until the night with Patrick. Knowing that he cared for her to politely ask me to leave showed that he had his priorities right. Patrick cared for Beth so well. Patrick's love, care, and commitment to Beth are incredible strengths that exemplify his loyalty and integrity as his remarkable traits.. Patrick and I sang with two other friends in a barbershop quartet throughout high school. While all four of us had similar personalities in one way or another, we also had big differences as well. Curt was a loner and had unique perspective on life. Clint was a follower and sought to be cool. I was, well, a pretty large nerd! Out of the three of us, I can only imagine we stuck together because of Patrick. Patrick wasn’t a commandeering, G.I. Joe commander leader. Patrick was a leader who brought out the best in all of us. Patrick knew when to push us and when to let loose and enjoy our friendship. Somehow Patrick embodied the traits that we all individually had and brought out the best of us as well. Most of all, he brought us together for a common purpose. One practice I can’t remember why, but the three of us were not focused. Something had us all rolling with laughter. A performance was coming up and I remember Patrick pushing us to get our goofiness under control. After what possibly could've been an hour of joking around, we left getting almost nothing done but a fun, memorable night of friendship. Another time, I remember singing at a large assembly for some church group. Patrick introduced us, led our group, and then we sat down for a meal after the performance with everyone else. After we ate I said some phrase to which Patrick asked if I had said “frog legs”. I hadn’t, but the inside joke was born. Throughout our high schoolyears any one of the four of us would say frog legs and a smile would accompany our face. While leadership in academic circles is ambiguous to define, it is essentially easy to measure: is someone following a leader? Patrick always has had someone following and has led with focus, determination, and with a holistic sense of the person as well.. Patrick is an amazing teacher. Teaching is an art form and requires a person with just the right level of patience, knowledge, and how to convey a piece of information through words and action. I remember in elementary school Patrick patiently taught me the sport of basketball. I had a very absentee father throughout my childhood years and I had no idea how to shoot, dribble, or do anything with a basketball. Through several hours of playing in his backyard, I learned all the necessary skills through this not standard tutor. Throughout middle and high school there were essential places where Patrick would stick up or slow down for me to help me through the awkwardness of puberty. I marveled at times how effortlessly he went through these years. While I did know there were obvious moments of struggle, things came naturally easy for Patrick. It would have been okay for him to move on quickly, but when I needed help with simple things like a project, harder things like cars, or even how to smoke a cigar when we were 18, Patrick just knew how to convey difficulties in life in simpler terms. As I remember numerous stories I recall the busyness he had during the Sophomore year of High school. Friday nights Patrick would suit up for the first half of football, come march in marking band in his football uniform, then often times play in the second half. Patrick carried a confidence without haughtiness that he was so comfortable in his own skin. It was this confidence that makes him a tremendous teacher in so many variety of people and places in life. I recently watched this when our families were both together in Nebraska while they were vacationing. Patrick’s mom and dad live on a lake and have a boat. As we were getting ready to go out and tube, he was there, talking to my daughter Evelyn about how to ride on a tube. While I don’t remember if she ever went on the tube, I do remember how I could see the strength of 30 years happen before my eyes. Patrick is a patience, confident, and effortless teacher.. You are at your best when, is hokey corporate talk. It sounds awkward. Yet I have seen you at your best. You are at your best when you are keeping your word. Two examples (both courtesy of Tony Mott). You held true to your word despite how uncomfortable the consequences turned out to be. The first was an ill-advised party that Tony threw for himself at Mickey Zopfi’s house. He invited half the RSOC. Tony was the only one that didn't realize nobody except his core group of friends would show up. For some reason, he put a lot of weight behind your appearance at the party. Some sort of friendship validation? You told him you would be there. The day of the party, the night wears on and no one shows up. Tony is crestfallen, but he takes your perceived flakiness the hardest. You had advised him earlier in the week that you would be late but would definitely be at the party. I remember sitting in Zof’s living room with glum Tony and the few other acquaintances that showed up. Tony lit up like a puppy when the front door opened downstairs and heard your voice. The following exchange shines in my memory. Tony chided you (despite his previous ebullience) about your tardiness. He told you that he thought you weren’t going to show. You seemed a little indignant but replied, “I told you I would be here.” You tried to leave it at that and moved on to greeting everybody else at the party. Tony wasn't convinced. Despite knowing that you would be late, he turned from grateful at your arrival to petulant. He implied that you were only arriving as an afterthought. Now he had your full attention. Your response: “If I say I’m going to do something, then I’m going to do it.” It was a proverbial mic drop. Tony relented and moved on to nurse the bruising his fail-party had given his ego. Yet his party was a success in one way. It served as an important moment for me in understanding what kind of person you were. That you carried yourself with honor and integrity even in the small things. The second example. Remember when you said you were going to quit smoking, and Tony called B.S. on your claim? I do. You told him that if you relapsed that he could punch you in the face. Fast forward a few days later at Tony Milani’s place. I can't remember which rock show we had seen earlier in the evening. But I know that the festivities afterwards involved a copious amount of drinking. The night’s libations ignited a nicotine craving within the smokers and former smokers (i.e., you) of the group. Milani lit one up. You lit one up. Then Tony Mott ran his mouth. He teased you for smoking and reminded you of the punch debt you now owed. Everyone in the group took it as a joke. No one would have blamed you for rolling your eyes at Tony and ignoring the issue. And yeah, you were drunk, but in vino veritas. Your expression hardened. I could hear the unspoken words: “If I say I’m going to do something, then I’m going to do it.” Tony did not think you were serious. I knew you were, though. By this point in our friendship, I had the full measure of how honorable you were. I knew that on this very night, you had decided that you were going to get punched in the face by Tony Mott. And that’s exactly what happened. Tony tried to get away with throwing a soft punch at your jaw. This only irritated you, and you told him that a weak punch was not part of the deal. So, Tony had to square up again and actually put some strength behind his fist. And he did. You didn’t get laid out, but he did knock you back. The group could tell it hurt. Tony could tell it hurt. You looked more pissed than in pain. But the debt was paid. Can someone be at their best while stupid drunk and getting punched in the face? Patrick James can.. In retrospect, it was unfair the extent to which I needed your help in the first few weeks after my leg surgery. I was naïve and had no idea how... crippled I would be. I could write several stories that speak to the strength of your character for the myriad ways you helped me when I was my most vulnerable. I do not want you to think that I took your aid for granted. If I ever seemed complacent or unthankful, it was the drugs. There was so much Percocet back then. You are at your best when you are standing up for others who cannot defend themselves. I will always be grateful for your help during that time. I knew that the Illizarov contraption was temporary. The screws secured to my bones and thrusting out my leg were one day going to be removed. The metal halos that prevented me from wearing anything other than shorts would one day be gone. I could hide the holes in my leg afterwards. I knew that the silence that spread table-to-table in restaurants as I limped by on crutches would not always be a hallmark of my passing. The stares of children. The faces twisted in disgust on people walking by. I knew that these things shouldn’t bother me. But I was young, and vain, and not immune toother people’s opinions on my appearance. I remember walking with you out of the SCIF at the end of a shift. Leadership had modified my schedule from 12s to 8s. They did this in order for you to be able to provide transportation for me to-and-from work. (Another one of the countless ways you helped out during that time). As we were descending the stairs from the building, two soldiers – a man and a woman, were making their way back in. When the woman saw me lumbering down the steps on crutches, my screws seeping body fluids, my leg ragged and swollen, she lost her professional bearing. She began yelling “oh my god, oh my god” with obvious disgust on her face. She kept staring at my leg and pointing as she and her partner approached. It hurt. She made no attempt to be polite. My leg revolted her, and she was making that clear. I tried to ignore it. I was on the staircase, in pain, and on crutches. It wounded my pride, but I had to focus on not falling as opposed to yelling out my hurt to this nobody. But you weren’t hurt. You were angry. You still had your hand on my shoulder when you turned to them as they passed and began berating them. “What the hell is wrong with you?” They moved on a few steps, the woman somewhat quieted, but you wouldn’t let the issue you go. “No, what the hell is wrong with you? The way you’re acting is gross. It’s fucking gross.” The woman squeaked out an “I’m sorry” and started to make an excuse about a weak stomach. I was in too much of a Percocet haze to remember much of the rest of the exchange. What I do remember is you making sure I was steady on my feet again and helping me walk out of the RSOC. All the while, you were commenting on how disgusting her behavior was. You were angrier than I was. It felt good to have gotten a word in on one of those a-holes that had made me feel like a freak in those first few weeks. You cooled off on the drive back to the apartment, and I think we went to Quizno’s afterwards. Which, by the way, you don’t see many of those nowadays. We should hit one up when you get back.. You are at your best when you are confronting your vulnerabilities. That is to say, when you have been your most vulnerable, I have seen you display your best traits. Loyalty. Reciprocated trust in friends. Security in your sense of identity -- knowing who you are. This particular entry is more flow-of-conscious than the other two. I am articulating a trait in which you excel that I've never expressed in words, and I apologize if the message does not stay consistent. I admire your ability to acknowledge the things in you that are vulnerable. I remember greeting the sun with you on Zof’s deck after a night of bacchanal. Our conversation had grown philosophical in the way that post-revelry conversations do. But we weren’t drunk anymore. We had sobered up before sunrise. (Somewhere between discussing the Civil War and complaining about work). The sun was well above the horizon when you began to speak on the passing of your grandmother. I remember the conversation well. In expressing those emotions, I could also see the expression of trust you made in telling it to me. It was powerful. I often bring up the following scene. Your dorm room. Talking about your relationship with Beth. The night that you confided that you actually missed her. It wasn’t just a sappy moment where a boy realizes he loves a girl. You explained the logic and the implication. You were keenly aware of what this vulnerability meant. You loved your parents. You loved your friends back home. But you did not miss them in a way that caused nostalgic longing. But you were hurting without Beth. Instead of moping, you applied logic to understand the meaning of these emotions. You turned that vulnerability into a realization. She must be the one. I’ve admired your ability to acknowledge your weaknesses. To understand what they mean about you or your circumstances. To be a parent that does right by their children, one has to expose themselves to the limits of their strengths. How frustrated can a human become before they contemplate eating their own children? What depths of fear can the heart and mind reach when they ponder the terror of harm coming to their children? How humbling to have the limits of your knowledge tested everyday as you try to explain to this newly made human how the world works? Un-involvement protects the selfish who aren’t willing to be their most vulnerable in front of children. They are doing their children a disservice. They are not engaged parents. I know that is not you. I have been lucky enough to see the type of father you are. You tap those inner reserves to raise your boys. You provide an example to them on how a man should carry himself. It requires facing those vulnerabilities on a daily basis. You're at your best in that vulnerability because you do not let it stop you from being a good father, or friend, or leader. The way in which you process the meaning of a personal weakness impresses me. Your method of incorporating that data makes you seem effortlessly confident at times. The fact that such confidence could only come from true acknowledgment of your limitations is something to which I aspire.",9

I saw many positive qualities shine through during our time as salespeople. Through countless customer interactions I saw Milissa quickly gain comfort in an initially foreign situation, despite clearly being out of her comfort zone.. This is less of a specific story and more of general trends I've experienced during my friendship with Milissa. I've found her to be deeply caring and understanding of people. She sees into the depths of those around her and draws understanding. Even so, she stays driven and focused towards her goals. Her decision to join the military has created strain and stress on friendships, which Milissa perceived and understood well, but she didn't let that stop her from pursuing her goals.. The last context I want to speak about Milissa in is that of the gym we both attend. I've watched Milissa's grow as an athlete and leader here. She shows resilience and resolve to improve her abilities constantly. I have also observed her stepping up to take on multiple leadership responsibilities around a community she cares deeply for. When she finds something she cares about, she digs in and becomes integrated with, and integral to that thing.. One year ago, I asked Milissa to work for me at the Minnesota Renaissance Festival as part of the staff of a business called “Angel Sword.” Angel Sword sells very high-end swords, knives, and other melee combat weapons. These pieces are not only extremely dangerous to handle, they’re extremely expensive compared to what the average patron expects to spend at that faire; ranging from $300 up to five-figure sums for a single item. Milissa agreed to work for us in a sales position for the 7-weekduration of the run despite having never worked at a festival before and having no experience in sales. Milissa not only handled the pieces safely and fluently, she quickly adapted to the high-pressure sales tactics, patiently and cheerfully endured the 12-hour work days, (on her feet the entire time in the 80-90-degree heat) and engaged patrons with clever wit, even providing support to the rest of the staff. Further, the business owner, who is known for being acerbic and difficult to work with, was repeatedly rebuffed, assuaged, or deftly reasoned with by Milissa who was only meeting him for the first time. This entire experience taught me about the depth of Milissa’s adaptability.. In the late fall of 2016, I accompanied Milissa on a week-long group trip to a Grecian island in the Aegean Sea. Milissa handled the acquisition of our lodgings, the logistics of the trip itinerary, co-ordination between those of us who were to be travelling along, and assisted with locating affordable plane tickets. Thanks to her efforts, not only were we able to acquire tickets for well under $1,000, far below what one would expect for such a trip, but our accommodations were equal parts affordable and beautifully appointed. Given the complexities of the trip itinerary, it went swimmingly. I could not have asked for a smoother or more enjoyable international vacation. It was from this experience that I learned the depths of Milissa’s resourcefulness.. Milissa is a student of mine in the Japanese swordsmanship martial art known as “Kenjutsu.” Although she is far from the only female student I have ever had, her tenure with the sword has stood far above the rest of them. She has thrived and steadfastly overcome every challenge I have given her in the context of an overwhelmingly male-dominated discipline - performing at, and often beyond, the level of her male peers. No other woman I have had as a student has made it half as far into the art in terms of skill and understanding as she has. After only a couple years of training, she has joined the expert-level group of my students, standing among the best. This is thanks to her commitment to individual practice and her personal drive to succeed. As my student, Milissa has proved to me the depth of her determination and diligence.. Milissa is one of the single most loyal people I know, I've never once seen her just give up on anyone in the 13 years we've been friends. She's always been willing to do just about anything for the people she cares about.. Milissa has an incredible amount of creativity, we paired up on numerous school projects and her approach was always so different than most people's, usually with pretty spectacular results. Especially when it came to our engineering project, we took the complete opposite approach as most of our class and ended up with one of the best bridges.. I greatly admire Milissa's resilience, we had probably one of the worst vacations ever and instead of letting all of the horrible things that happened ruin the entire trip she stayed very upbeat throughout.. Milissa, I am so very proud of you! You have grown into a woman that any man should be proud to spend the rest of their life with! I miss that little girl that went camping with the scouts, played the game of turning off my tv for attention, and the wonderful adventures we’ve been on. It reminds me of the time when you always talked about taking a trip to the island on Lake Alexander over and over again. Then one day you and Luke went out on the boat and did just that.....You were determined and dedicated to make that long journey across the lake and back (if we didn’t spoil it by picking you up)....You have such great determination and, to what I have learned recently, an interest in completedness. Specifically, when you play video games like Zelda and want to complete all the side quests and acquire all the other pieces to the games. You truly like to see things to the end and expect greatness. Keep up the great work....You seem to provide us with many reasons to hold up our heads as you amaze us with the things you do and accomplish.. In this little story, I want to tie in your completedness with creativity and inventiveness. I recall, not so long ago, that you had a desire to make a headboard out of pallets. Working together with you brought me so much joy. It is times like that for which I will hold in my memory for a lifetime! You came up with the idea, we worked together on how we could make it happen and then we spent the time to bring it to life. This is also relevant in the artwork that you produce. You have come along way with you artwork. The details, the different mediums you utilize astound me. The one thing that I like and respect about it is that you use traditional art with pencils, chalks, paints and not the digital renderings that others use.. The final story that came to mind in this short time of reflection is remembering our move from Little Sauk to Fort Ripley. I recall the sadness and difficulty that seemed to bother you and so I hung onto that too, for you. Looking at it from a distance (overtime), that move has helped shape your character. You seem to embrace travelling to other places and distant lands. You seem okay to spend time alone and have learned to be self-reliant. Even though you Mom and I enjoy being involved with your life decisions and interests. I am very proud of you and I trust that you will have a very successful and rewarding time going forward in your life. I Love YOU more than these words can express and know that we are here for you as you travel into these ""uncharted waters”.. Milissa is her best when she is under pressure has to deal with time restraints. Just recently she was told that she had to report to OTS in about a month. She had to do about 60 days of prep work, reading, testing and physical work before she arrived at OTS. Milissa was able to look ahead at all of her tasks and created a daily time schedule that allowed her to take her time, concentrate, do well and even threw in time to relax. She stays focused on the task at hand. Milissa was very determined to do her best and with the short time restraints. She was able to accomplish everything that needed to be done by preplanning.. Milissa is at her best when she is learning something new. She takes her time to understand what is being taught, asks questions and did a lot of online researching. During her high school and college schooling, Milissa would spend hours upon hours reading and studying. We had to assure Milissa that it was okay to take a break from studying and to go out meet friends and to have fun. She is always determined to do her best.. Milissa is very creative and detail oriented. Ever since she was young, she always has a pencil and a drawing tablet with her. She has drawn numerous portraits of images she has found on line or taken from photo pictures (even by requests of professional athletes). AMAZING work. Milissa has also taken this creativity to the next level and taught painting classes. Milissa empowered the participants to have fun, relax, forget about work. She took the fear of painting out of people that attended. She is very creative and very detailed oriented.",15

For me being his sister I see it most in his life regarding his family. All growing up it was there and I didn't really pay attention to it or appreciate it until the last couple years as I've gotten older. There has been times when like any family when one of us younger siblings have done something that clearly would not be okay with the parents for doing and EVERY time without fail he would be the first to cover for us. Even though at times the parents would still know or find out eventually what we did it was the thought that counted for me. His loyalty to try and save my butt even if it meant him getting a lecture meant a lot to me and still does.. Another thing that stands out to me about Jeremiah is his willingness to help. I've always struggled with writing papers. In high school and in college even now I still struggle with it. No matter if it was 3 months in advance or the day before if I ever asked him to help me write a paper he would always make time to help me. That might now seem like a big deal - but when I was calling him at midnight the night before the paper was due asking him to help me, and even with it being that last minute for him to stay on the phone and talk me through different ideas and different ways for me to word things for my paper, it was a big deal to me. He makes time for the things he cares about and loves.. Our family is pretty big into the gym. Its a life-style my dad has always been into and really stressed on all of us kids that it was a good discipline for us to do. Well about a year ago I decided I was going to really try and get into the shape I wanted to be in. I've been going to the gym off and on for a couple years but it was always just doing cardio. Well at that time most the other siblings and the parents all went to the gym at a time where I couldn't go with any of them. All but Jer. I've never lifted weights before so I had asked him to help teach me how to do everything and very willingly he did and so we started working out together every day. One thing that I quickly noticed was that once he put his mind to something he wasn't about to let it go. For instance, I was not a easy person to teach. But no matter how much I complained or as many times as I had the wrong form doing my workouts he never once gave up on me or let me quit. He kept telling me, ""you asked me to help you and I'm not going to let you quit"". At the time I disliked him very much for it but now I wouldn't be where I am without him pushing me to be better and not to quit. His discipline to get up with me early every morning amazed me and encouraged me. Once Jeremiah starts something he wont quit until he sees it through.. Jeremiah and I have taken many camping trips together. We both have busy schedules so once a trip is planned we do everything in our power to go. Sometimes the weather is less than favorable or other things arise that make it a challenge. The most memorable trip I can remember was several years ago, we were having record rain fall and most of the park was flooded. The shorelines had come up over 30ft and it was predicated to rise another 15 the night we were camping. We debated on leaving that night but decided we were up for the challenge. The next 24 hours the rain was unbelievable. The shorelines rose more than expected and the road we had come in was flooded with 4 foot of water above the pavement. The rain let up some during the days and Jeremiah scrounged around managing to find some kindling dry enough to burn. He somehow made meals in the rain. We eventually packed up our soaking wet gear and made our way out by foot, cutting a trail through the forest back to a vehicle. The trip was exhausting, a lot of work and less than favorable by any standard. The story may seem silly but the point is Jeremiah has always been one for adventure. He has a need to be challenged. Most people would have backed down from the weather and stayed home where everything was comfortable and warm. Instead he chose to take the challenge and became a tougher man because of it. He never complained but rather had the grit to overcome the obstacle and make a hell of a memory.. We started Jeremiah at age 7 learning how to play the piano. When Jeremiah was 13he wanted to quit piano lessons. For 6 years he had been the model student. He was diligent to practice everyday as well as do all his theory. I was surprised that he wanted to quit. He had been told since he started lessons that he would take until he was 18. So I decided to take a different approach by asking him what goals he had wanted to achieve in piano. His response was that he wanted to write music by the time he was 18. Since that goal had not been achieved I encouraged him to start working towards writing music. This challenge to achieve his goals motivated him for the next 4 years till he left for college. He not only accomplished his goal (composing6 songs with lyrics) but when on to play for a group in college. I was so proud of the discipline and tenacity that he displayed. He isn't a quitter :). Jeremiah is the oldest of 7 children. The youngest sibling is 10 years younger than he is. Having 7 that close in age required help, especially when they were all young. I could always depend on Jeremiah to help in any way that I needed, from changing diapers to watching them all when I needed to go to the store. When he got his license he drove all of them to youth events, went grocery shopping for me and to this day thinks to pick up Starbucks for me before he comes to the house. He has always been trustworthy, dependable and reliable. The best part he never complained when once again I asked for his help. I will always want him on ""my team!!"". One of the greatest things about having children is watching them become adults. Adulthood to me means not shying away from responsibility and then learning from mistakes. From the time Jeremiah left home for college at age 17, he took complete responsibility for his life as an adult. He made future decisions with goals in mind. In order to accomplish those goal he worked a part time job to pay for college and when that wasn't enough he joined the Air National Guard to pay for the rest. He worked diligently to balance all of them, learning from his mistakes along the way.. Jeremiah is a member of a church of nearly 1000 members and was the primary instrumental force behind developing and implementing a church wide security team to provide protection during church services and special events. As the pastor of the church I had asked a number of other men to help with this endeavor but with little success. There was no real template at the time for something of the scale we needed and men I asked did not have the leadership or administrative abilities to develop the program. Knowing Jeremiah was younger than anyone I had asked before, I was uncertain if he could do what I was asking but knew he had great leadership potential. Within a few months Jeremiah developed a complete and comprehensive program complete with policies, training manual, recruiting requirements and dove-tailed the program into our larger emergency response program. Beyond developing the program he oversaw the implementation of the program and led it for the first two years until military duty took him away. He personally recruited over 25 individuals and oversaw their required licensing and training through CLEET certification in Oklahoma. He developed a yearly budget and oversaw the purchase of all needed equipment including radios, uniforms, church site wide surveillance system, monitors, etc. The program because one of the best in our state and Jeremiah helped several other churches in developing their own church security programs. Jeremiah was the youngest member of the team but still led and was followed by men many years his senior, including police officers, former military members, and members of the church.. A memory of Jeremiah's leadership ability relates to his high school football days. Jeremiah was a member of a relatively new Home school football program that was in the early stages of development. He played running back and wide receiver. Finding teams to play was difficult as they were not part of the public/private school systems so they played whomever they could. On one occasion they played a team considerably about their ability and skill level. It would be equivalent of a 3A high school team playing a 6A team according to classification of sizes. It was clear from the beginning his team was overmatched. However, Jeremiah as a running back and leader of the team was looked to throughout the game for inspiration. I watched as a team coach how Jeremiah throughout the game inspired and encouraged others with his play, his vocal encouragement, and tenacity. There were a number of times he took a genuine beating as running back and a lesser hearted individual would have come out of the game. His attitude was that if he quit or came out of the game it would hurt the spirit of the team and he played through injury and abuse to provide an example and be a leader. Instead of crying foul or stating the game was not fair he took it as a personal challenge to play his best and encourage his team mates to do the same. After the game though his team was beaten the opposing coaches to a man found Jeremiah and told him he played with more heart and grit than any running back they had played against. Though smaller than most he was still tougher. It was a memorable night to watch a young man give his all in adverse conditions and do so as leader and good spirit.. One of the things that stand out to me about Jeremiah is his well roundedness and variety of interests. This has made him a young man well versed in a number of subjects, disciplines, and abilities. In high school Jeremiah excelled in athletics and was a captain and leader of his teams. At the same time Jeremiah became an accomplished pianist and developed a love and knowledge of music. He also loved history and completed a degree at the University of Oklahoma with a history major. During his time at OU Jeremiah worked his way through college as a bank teller learning a great deal about the banking/loan industry. He proved his work ethic during this time by serving in the Air Guard, taking piano lessons, working a part time job, studying for school, and serving in his local church. During this time Jeremiah also took time to take a missions trip overseas and was a team leader of that group. At the same time of all these endeavors Jeremiah was the eldest of 7 siblings and always made time to spend with his family and to be an encourager to each of them in their life pursuits. He is an incredibly well rounded and experience individual with an appreciation for history, arts, science, and developing himself professionally and helping others reach their goals as well.. Tags: Kindness, IncluderI remember one night I took my wife and children to Jeremiah’s parent's house to see some new puppies that had been born. It was a beautiful summer evening and we were letting our kids run and play in the yard with the puppies. Jeremiah stopped by to see his folks and came outside to talk with us. Moments later he scooped up my two-year-old son and started playing with him and making him laugh. I have known Jeremiah for most of his life and have watched him on countless occasions engage children and love them and make them smile. All four of my children still enjoy his presence and warmth. He possesses a remarkable ability to interact with children and make them feel at ease.. Tags: Determination, Command, Developer The church that I work at has grown to over 850 in attendance each Sunday. A few years ago we were in need of starting a security team. It was difficult to find someone willing to invest the time and effort needed to get a security team together and who possessed the innate leadership abilities to lead a group of men. Jeremiah possessed the leadership traits needed and willingness. The greatest difficulty Jeremiah had to overcome was leading men who were more than twice his age. I attended the first meeting as he assumed the leadership role and watched as he started a security team out of nothing and provided the needed the leadership our church needed. Jeremiah started something from nothing and put our security team on a solid path for future growth and development.. Tag: Creativity, Ideation Our church was hosting a special event and we needed someone to write some skits to reinforce the message we were endeavoring to communicate. Jeremiah was tasked with writing the skits and created a parody of Pixar’s “The Incredibles.” Not only did Jeremiah write the skits but he acted in them. The skits ended up being a huge success and the people who attended loved them. Jeremiah exhibited the ability to understand what was needed and showed creativity and resourcefulness to produce and execute an entertaining and meaningful message.. Jeremiah, Months ago when I was organizing the hiring board for a new 14N, I knew there was one thing I was looking for in a new officer: Integrity. Not the skills, because skills I can teach, but integrity to do the right thing for our Airmen. It’s the maturity and personal drive to have integrity in every action that makes you stand out. Before going to Maxwell, you were the NCO that reminded others to swallow their pride, to think outside the box, to break out of complacency and laziness, and that is what is going to make you a great officer. I often look at you and Vaughan and think, ‘These are the Lts I’m leaving my shop with’, but I’m confident and comfortable that you will take these Airmen (and our mission) to the right places at the right time. Thank you for being true to yourself and true to me, and keep that whenever you’re confronted with personal and professional challenges in the months/years to come. You've now got the technical experience coupled with personal ethics to form a great foundation for a lasting and successful career. I am looking forward to having you back here, ready to hit the ground running like you do.. Jeremiah, I can’t get away with not bragging on your technical intelligence though....Yes you know ethics and morals are EXTREMELY IMPORTANT, but it makes my intelligence analyst heart happy that you love what you do! I’ve never met someone here so determined to learn and to teach, and not only determined, but talented. You truly take the time to dig into systems and tactics, or whatever it may be, and I’m glad to have you on my side as we forge a stronger bonder between Intel and pilots. I gave a huge Intel brief this morning for Vinny and thought about you and how you would've done it. I’m ready for you take a stab at planning internal and external training, and helping me whip these analysts ‘into shape’.",15

Earning this honor is not an easy road, nor one that many teenagers set out upon. Douglas gave countless hours to the Scouts, in both serving and completing tasks. For his final project, Douglas worked at a property owned by an old woman who was known for her selfless care of wildlife, and especially injured wildlife. For his final project in the Scouts program, Douglas planned and constructed a roofed and fenced habitat for the animals being rehabilitated into the wild at the aforementioned property. On more than one occasion, my family members bought sick or injured wildlife, such as rabbits, squirrels, and tortises to this property; therefore, we have been in the direct and positive impact that Douglas has made as a young leader on this community.. I have served with Doug for 15 years as part of a praise band and throughout those years I have seen first hand his development from a young man to a leader of men and women twice his age. There were are many occasions when the band as a whole would be in disagreement about what path to take or how to get to a specific point and Doug would take charge, make his voice be heard, and articulate his plan in away that others would agree on and follow. Even on occasions when his own father would disagree with him, he would be able to take control of the situation and lead the band where it needed to be.. During the time we have known him, Douglas has proved to be a quiet leader. We have witnessed many times in which Douglas has taken a quiet yet definite role in both our friendships and in our organized band. He is able to make his points or opinions be known without offending others, and has a way of asking for others' thoughts and making valid and positive decisions on things that will effect a group of people.. Douglas had just cross t over to Boy Scouts from Cub Scouts when I first met Douglas. He had a walking cast on his lower leg and was ready to have fun on his first camp out as a Boy Scout. He helped with setting up troop gear and his own before dark. Saturday was a 2.5 mile hike to the U.S. Seal museum and then 2.5miles back to camp. Even with a cast full of crushed shell rock Doug continued to help with camp chores and activity with no complaints. He was ready to travel out of State for a week of Summer Camp.. We had set out to canoe the first 75 miles of the Sawanee River from Fargo, Ga. to Live Oak, Fl. First day was about 4 hours on the river before we set up camp on the river bank. Good dinner, good nights rest and a good breakfast and a good start on the river. That quickly changed with the rain and a drop in temp. We were all cold wet in need of a break. We made a stop under a bridge and tried to warm up. Then one adult on the trip said why not just call the outfitters to pick us up and go home. Doug was one of the first to say ( lets get to the shoals and see if there is change for the better ). We had a good meal and a nights sleep and ready to finish our goal... There were me any out standing events with Doug that. Brought him to complete his Eagle project. Doug had to chose a project that would benefit the community. This was to show his leadership skills to take his project from concept to completion. Doug chose to build a pre-release building for an animal rehab center. The building was a large screen room so that those to be released could feel almost free. Doug demonstrated outstanding leadership with his Eagle project and with his daily living. I am every proud to say I know Douglas Gifford.. Doug has been a musician since he was eleven years old. In college, he studied music and primarily played the trombone for school. This, of course required a great deal of practice. With full-time classes and two part-time jobs, his only spare time, such as it was, was at night. The trombone is not a subtle or quiet instrument and our neighbors, unsurprisingly, were having none of his after midnight practice. This meant that he had to go back to campus and practice in the dead of night. And so he did, what seemed to me like every day. So, he’s an excellent musician. But that’s not what this story is about. It’s about Doug's dedication to commitments and goals without allowing any one commitment to eclipse the others. He would practice well into the night, attend classes, rehearsals, performances, work, other work, and then repeat the whole process. I'm still struck by what an impressive balance he struck the and how well he continues to balance commitments now.. In 2014, Doug decided he was going to go to Scotland, alone, to hike the length of the country over the course of a month. It wasn’t the first trip he had ever planned, but it was the most ambitious. He planned everything meticulously: exactly where he would be at any given moment, what he would need down to the smallest accessory, when he would be able to contact family, absolutely everything. So, yes, Doug is an exemplary planner – I still have the spreadsheets to prove it. But more importantly, he knows better than to follow the plan at the expense of good sense. In Scotland, this meant knowing when to take a bus to a town with a famous bookstore rather than finishing the day’s scheduled hike in dangerously inclement weather. Or when to take a campsite at a caravan park rather than spend all night searching for the only two square yards in all of Scotland flat enough to pitch a tent. To me, the ability to make a wise decision in the moment, regardless of what was planned or expected, is one of Doug’s many exceptional qualities. That ability was demonstrated most notably on a trip that, while it may not have gone exactly as planned, certainly taught him what he was capable of.. The third story is less a story and more the fact that the first two exist. Not that those things happened, but that I wrote them. From anyone else, this request would have been met with a polite declination. From those stories, you know that Doug throws every bit of himself into everything his every undertaking. This quality also inspires those around him to improve, to do more than they would on their own. It inspired me, his idle and inarticulate sister, to do this difficult thing. I have seen it inspire our family and his friends to improve and challenge themselves. Doug is always encouraging, but this is an innate quality all the more remarkable and, to me, enviable, for how natural and selfless it is.. In October, 2016, as hurricane Matthew approached our area, it became clear that we were in for a severe weather event, for which there was little time to prepare. I was planning on using our RV as living quarters after the storm, as it would be possible to enjoy air conditioning and all other modern conveniences by using a small generator and LP gas. I was going to be home the morning before the storm was due to arrive, to prepare the house and property. As forecast updates were received, I began to realize that there was a very good chance that the RV might not remain upright, and would be of no use to us after the storm. Although I was sure that the house would be a safe place during the storm, we would have no power or water afterwards. I made the decision that we would do as much house preparation as we could, and head west in the RV, returning after the storm had passed. There was a lot that needed to be done to the house and out buildings before we would leave, and I knew it was not possible to accomplish in the short time we had. At this point, Doug suggested that my wife and I leave in the RV, and that he and his sister would stay behind, and that he would take care of all the necessary storm preparation. When I was his age, this would most likely result in a hurricane party with very little hurricane preparation. I gave him a long list of tasks ad my wife and I hit the road. As we drove, I kept texting him with additional tasks as I thought of them. It turned into quite a long list and I didn’t think that it would be possible to accomplish everything. We returned home after the storm to find the house, property, and outbuildings in very good shape, with all preparation tasks completed to perfection. I was not surprised. When Doug says he is going to do something, you can bank on it.. Doug began working with me at Anchorage Manufacturing around August, 2015 as a machinist trainee. At the time, we had started using Solid works CAD CAM software for design and CNC programming. None of us were very proficient with the new software and found ourselves reverting to the old ways of doing things just so we could get something accomplished. Doug, with very little CAD CAM or machining experience, dove headlong into Solid works, and by the end of his first week, was showing us how to produce CNC code with the new software. His ability to wrap his head around technology has always been uncanny. He was soon setting up and running a 4 axis Wire EDM, slicing jet engine blades and vanes for inspection. It wasn’t long before he fully understood CNC code and could edit on the fly. I have known many good machinists who were never able to do that. When it comes to learning new technology or problem solving, Doug has no fear, he just does it.. As a worship leader and a leader of a contemporary Christian musical group, Doug was faced with a quite a variety of personalities and levels of musical talent. Not only do people have their own ideas regarding how music should be performed, they also tend to drift off task by socializing with their fellow musicians, and wasting a great amount of time. Having been a worship leader myself, I know what a challenge it can be to keep everyone on task and productive during rehearsals. I have had the pleasure of playing in Doug’s band in Orlando twice and was always impressed with the way he was able to keep a motley assortment of singers, musicians, and sound people headed in the same direction at the same time. When necessary, he would be firm and clear about what needed to be done at any given moment, bringing any situation back under control quickly. I couldn’t help but be impressed by the amount of respect and loyalty he commanded as a leader. When Doug moved back to Port Saint Lucie to go to work for Anchorage Mfg., he re-joined our Praise band and brought his leadership skills with him. The leader of our band, while being a very capable leader, would tend to get off track during rehearsals, discussing sports events and personal business. Doug, without most people realizing it, would get us back on task and productive again. Doug has shown time and time again his ability to be a great leader as well as an exemplary team player.. When I started with the Praise Team Band at First United Methodist Church, it was my first time playing in such a group, let alone the rock genre. Doug served as a sort of mentor; he was there to answer questions for me, offer advice that lifted me up instead of pushing me down, and more. To this day, much of my style when playing is influenced by what I learned from Doug via emulation and teaching. In these ways, he cares about other people and their success, not just his own.. When I was rushing for Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, I was pleased to receive a message from Doug Gifford that he had been in this organization as well. This Brotherhood seeks to lift mankind up as a whole, not selectively or with self-serving bias. As such, it was no surprise that Doug was involved in it. The men admitted to Phi Mu Alpha are of the highest caliber, soundest character, and most manly musicianship. I respect Doug's dedication to his musical craft, through everything he has done in his life.. Finally, Doug has been not only a devout follower of important morals and principles, but a leader. He led the Praise Team in times of uncertainty, making the final say after hearing other opinions first. This shows his focus on people and their myriad of differences, something I still struggle with myself. Doug also has shown incredible respect for my family, the challenges we've faced in recent years, and more. Not only does he care for people, and care for morals, but he is persistent and loyal. I have the utmost respect for someone who understands the rigor and principles of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia. Kudos, Doug.. Doug started out as a young man in our praise band at church. I clearly recall his nervousness at that first session. But he persisted, practicing and practicing, playing in other settings, always improving. I think that persistence and focus is a great strength that will pay dividends in the future. Doug has been a member of the praise band under several different leaders. He has adapted to the different leadership styles and the challenges that each of them can bring. His adaptability and fast learning/changing skills are a great gift.. I don’t think I have ever seen Doug lose his cool; he has maintained a healthy self-control as long as I have known him. And there have been challenges, from the simple broken guitar string in the middle of the song to interpersonal ‘band’ things. He has kept it together through it all. Well done!",18

Aaron is a senior enlisted member of the section. When the Officer in charge was transferred he was faced with a difficult task of taking over the section. The section he was now in charge of was going into their inspection cycle. There are many different and critical areas in the Intelligence Section that are inspected. Aaron prepared for months getting ready for this very important inspection. He came through it with a couple of the areas getting “Best Practice” in all the Command. Aaron is not afraid to take on a challenge. He will do everything he can to hold people responsible for their job. He is a born leader.. After being in the section for only two years, Aaron had a friend that was interested in joining the same section. They are very close and came to the ANG from the Army Nation Guard together. The friend that Aaron brought to the section and was hired had a few bad first couple of months. He was going through some personnel problems and having a hard time making it to work on time. Aaron as his supervisor was able to pull him out of his slump and get him back on the right path. Aaron had to make some tough professional decisions and also some personnel decisions. That individual is now a rock star and doing great in the section.. Sgt Jensen goes above and beyond to do everything that he can to help his co-workers when family events come up. I have seen multiple example of Sgt Jensen helping to ensure that family is put first. One such example was when he petitioned to allow me to learn my F-16 IFTU material in house, rather than spending 5 weeks doing it in residence. Not only did he take the time to petition for the waiver that allowed me to do this, but he then took the time to teach me all the material that I would have been responsible for had I attended the course with the rest of my peers. This allowed me to stay home for the end of my wife’s pregnancy and the birth of my daughter, and is something that I will never be able to repay him for. More recently he did the same thing for a fellow intel member. When he personally worked out away to find a way for him to swap out of a 3 month deployment. Because of SgtJensen’s work, this member was able to stay with his son and take part in the first months of his life, rather than missing so many of the important firsts that happen at that young age.. Sgt Jensen’s focus on ensuring that those under him are recognized, both formally and informally. I have never known another supervisor to put such a personal emphasis on ensuring their members receive formal awards, as well as individualized recognition. Again there is no specific example to point to, because he is always going above and beyond to ensure this happens.. Sgt Jensen is hands down the most inspiring leader and supervisor I have ever known. One of the most impressive aspects of his leadership, is the manner in which he leads by example. It’s hard to give specific examples of this, because he inconstantly leading by doing, and acting as a mentor that every airman should strive to emulate. There is no doubt in my mind, that regardless of the situation, regardless of the scenario, You can always count on Sgt Jensen to have made the right decision and to be conducting and leading with integrity, purpose, and honor.. One of Aaron’s greatest strengths is his capacity for compassion. He addresses individual needs and work’s tirelessly to ensure his colleagues have everything they need to be successful. In this, he thoughtfully anticipates needs and selflessly sacrifices to ensure the best experience for his team.. Another fantastic strength is his attention to detail. The foundation of that focus is based out of necessity as he is a resource steward and works to ensure tasks are done with little nonsense and waste. His customers, our pilots, demand the same no-nonsense solutions, a likely motivator.. Another trait I admire is his capacity to focus on the strengths of his team members, and assign tasks based on those. He understands the different personalities of his team and what motivates them. He empowers them to excel by setting standards and context, and allowing the passion of the team member to drive the level of effort in projects.. Military I first met Aaron on the rifle range at Ft. McCoy. Aaron was calm, confident, funny, and had a good head on his shoulders. He knows what he wants and he puts his mind, hard work, and effort into getting it. In 2015, we deployed together for 15months. During that time Aaron was not the highest ranking soldier in the section, yet he was the best intel soldier in the section hands down. Between the analysis, products, writing, and briefs there wasn’t anything we couldn’t trust him to hit out of the park. Aaron might not have agreed with other NCO’s and soldiers in the section, yet he kept his discipline and patience in check. After we returned Aaron new a change was needed. As Aaron does, he did the research and came up with the best move for him. Aaron changed over to the Air National Guard. He could have gone anywhere and been very successful. Since changing over, Aaron has traveled the world for deployments and schools, and is now taking the next step to becoming an officer. Aaron’s intelligence, personality, patience, analysis, leadership ability, and all-around character make him an asset to any unit he is in and leads.. VFWI joined the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) in 2010, VFW Post 7591, the same Post where Aaron is a member. In 2011 I became the Junior Vice Commander. One of my duties was recruiting and retention. I asked Aaron if I could bounce a couple of ideas off of him. He kindly said “yes”. While listening, Aaron also came up with ideas and improvements which he said he would help me with. He is slick with computers and was able to develop a monthly and weekly brochure that showed what Post 7591 has to offer on a weekly and monthly basis. Aaron was more than happy and more than willing to assist with informing new members on what the VFW can do for them and what they can volunteer for at the VFW. He attended meetings, brought down new veterans to show them what it was all about, answered any questions they may have had, and even signed them up if and when they were ready. Last October Aaron participated in our first Operation Ruck 22 march to bring awareness and funds to veterans suicide. Not only did he march, he found two other airmen to march with us. Not super happy with the t-shirt logo for the first annual event, Aaron said that he would design the t-shirt for the next year’s event. Even though he will be finishing up the officer basic training, and preparing for a big change on the home front, he said he would absolutely love to assist with the event this October by designing the new t-shirt. Aaron is willing and able to assist his fellow Airmen, veterans, and their families. He takes on projects, even when not asked, knowing that he will be making an impact on people's lives.. Friend I was asked to play on a coed softball team, soon after we got back from deployment. Aaron was the big bopper on the team and cranked dingers. It was an eclectic group of teammates that showed up and played to have fun. Aaron was always welcoming and encouraging on the field, and  when it came to going to the pub afterwards. He is a solid athlete, and good friend. A couple of summers after the team disbanded, I received an invitation to Aaron’s wedding. The wedding displayed some of the qualities that Aaron portrays. It was outside in the open, surrounded by laughs and smiles, and it made you feel happy and at ease. Aaron has been a kind, generous, and loyal soldier, airmen, and friend. He will soon be a beaming and proud father. I am happy to have Aaron and his family in my life.. I started working with Aaron when he was an E-3 in the Wisconsin Army National Guard. We both worked together in a joint Army / Air Guard program called Counterdrug. Aaron started out as a truck driver for the Army. Counterdrug hired him as a Criminal Analyst. Due to his natural talent and hard work, he succeeded in Counterdrug and re-classed in the Army into the Intelligence field. He later switched services from the Army to the Air Guard when he realized the Army's career path for Intelligence personnel was more limited than the Air's path. Since then, Aaron has demonstrated repeatedly that his natural talent and willingness to work hard to improve his knowledge and skills make for a hard-to-beat combination. Aaron is among the best Analysts I have worked with.. There's no specific story for this one, as I'm old and don't remember any specific event. That said, one of the things that's always impressed me about Aaron are his skills as a trainer. When he got hired as the full-time Intelligence NCO for the Fighter Wing, he took over developing the training plan and working with junior personnel to ensure they got the training they needed. Aaron was remarkably patient with those he was training, and went out of his way to help them understand the complex subject matter. He also gets along well to other members in the Intel shop, carefully balancing that line between authority and being approachable. Even though he's exceptionally knowledgeable, Aaron finds the right balance so that people seek him out for answers without being intimidated.. Last fall I contacted Aaron to get the current base commander's e-mail address. My intent was to e-mail the base commander to see if he would authorize a medic to staff a mental health information table during an event at our VFW Post. The event was Operation Ruck 22, an event where the participants ruck-marched 22 miles to help increase awareness of the 22 veterans who commit suicide every day in the United States. Rather than simply pass along the e-mail, Aaron volunteered to participate in the event, and brought along two of his co-workers at the Fighter Wing. Aaron coordinated getting an extra pack for one of the participants who didn't have one. Aaron completed the 22 mile march with those co-workers. The point of this short story is that Aaron regularly exceeds expectations and goes out of his way to help others, both professionally and personally.. Aaron has proven to be an inventive problem solver and leader. Recently Aaron was tasked with creating multiple exercise scenario for a multi-unit exercise from scratch. Aaron managed to accomplish this in a short timeframe. Aaron showed his ability to think outside the box to work with multiple units, several sections and a large group of aviators across multiple military branches. Aaron was able to develop multiple fluid scenarios to help units meet many different units training objectives. Aaron was able to achieve this in a very dynamic environment as unit training managers regularly changed their objectives during the exercise. Aaron ultimately created a complex and robust exercise scenario that ultimately allowed the exercise to apply for and be accepted to begin the process of becoming joint accredited by the Air Force to prep units for deployment. As one of Aaron’s supervisors I saw his spectacular problem-solving abilities, excellent interpersonal skills, and well beyond normal leadership abilities. Aaron is very good at bringing out the best in peoples work and easily gets them to strive to perform to the best of their abilities.. Aaron is very concerned about the morale and welfare of the people around him. Aaron is a model leader that truly cares about the wellbeing of his fellow airman. Aaron is one of the members in the unit that is always willing to lend a hand to get the job done. A few years ago Aaron identified that our section morale and esprit decors had fallen from previous years. Aaron worked hard to rebuild team morale and cohesion. Aaron ultimately resurrected a naming ceremony tradition that had previously fallen to the curb for multiple years. This ceremony has greatly added to our sections morale. Aaron also organizes and plans several section activities throughout the year over drill weekends to create team-building opportunities and unit cohesion outside of work. Aaron makes sure to know what is going on in the lives of the people he works with and strives to adapt his approach to assist those individuals and help them feel as a needed part of our successful team. Aaron is someone who would give you the shirt off of his back if he knew it would help them feel better. He has never once not gone out his way to help someone out or open his home to them.. Aaron leads by example at all times. Aaron is a knowledgeable expert in multiple fields. Aaron works hard on a daily basis to make sure he knows the information he needs to make the team successful. Even with the massive amount of information and credibility Aaron has built from his hard work Aaron is humble and approachable to everyone. Aaron is always willing to take the time to teach and mentor other members of the team without making them feel as if it’s a bother to Aaron. Aaron makes sure to mentor and teach in a way that makes everyone feel like a valuable part of the team. Aaron has become a trusted advisor to many individuals in the unit. There are just too many examples where Aaron has been the quintessential expert that helped come up with a creative solutions to list in this forum.. How to start this... One time at band camp there was a bear... j/k there was a time when we first met when if something broke or quite working, you would be quick to just go buy new, or a replacement. Now it's more likely you will look into a solution or reach out to me or another friend to fix or rectify the problem. You are not afraid to reach out to others when you may not know exactly what you are doing, to me that takes courage and shows leadership qualities.. We started taking a annual trip to the north woods (Minocqua) I would haul my boat we would fish a different lake everyday and have a blast. The first year we went, any lake we would go to I would make 90 percent of the decision on where we would fish, weather it would be the lake or where we go on that lake. After a couple of days and a few lakes you started making the decisions on what lakes to go to or where to fish on those lakes, I feel like you took time to analyze how we where fishing, even studied the lakes a bit, started reading structure to find the best places to catch fish, nobody I have taken fishing has ever took the time to learn as you have, again taking initiative and willingness to not only get better but to excel.. Honestly this last story is just to tell you I've had to do this all with my cell phone for some reason my computer will not let me log into the app and you're not here to walk me through fixing it. Not only are you a good friend Aaron you are a good role model to others and I thank you. Aaron will help anyone, anywhere, anytime if needed. He truly exhibits selflessness in his actions. He has helped stranded motorists, people whose homes are threatened by fire, airmen struggling with a problem, etc. It doesn’t matter what the issue or task is, Aaron gives of himself to help others.. Aaron has a great ability to lead a professional and disciplined work center, while also making/allowing the workplace to be fun.. Aaron has an excellent ability to lead from below, even when faced with superiors that are unprofessional, unethical, or otherwise not exhibiting good leadership traits. Aaron's positive leadership drowns out that negative influence and successfully shields those below/around him from the harmful influence.. Aaron is caring and dependable, and makes sure the important people in his life and mine are taken care of. He often puts the needs and wishes of others before himself, offering to help friends or family with projects or with technological troubleshooting issues. I could mention lots of instances that demonstrate this is true, but one that comes to mind is when Aaron recently asked me about my preferences in caring for our parents in their old age, should that need arise. He let me know that he’s willing to have our parents live with us if they become unable to care for their homes rather than having them go to assisted living facilities. I was surprised that we were having the conversation at all this early, but we did just move into a new house and he was already thinking about which room would be theirs. He regularly thinks of the future like this when making decisions, and I was blown away by his thoughtfulness (though I'm still pretty sure my dad would burn down our house).. Aaron is rational, fair, and diplomatic. When we disagree or argue he always remains calm, argues his points but makes an effort to see my perspective and empathize. Bless him for that, because I’m completely the opposite. He learns what he can from any given situation and makes adjustments in the future. But isn’t that what everyone should want from an argument? To have the other person listen, not blowup, offer solutions and follow through? Sorry Aaron, you don’t get a specific story for this one. I expect you can remember arguments we’ve had, so I’m sure I don’t need to remind you of any specifically. I expect that this contributes to his quality as a supervisor and as an employee in his workplace. While I don’t observe him in that capacity I would expect that his rationality, fairness and problem-solving skills make him an outstanding person to work with. I’m his wife so I’m allowed to take it for granted, but these are the qualities I respect in my coworkers and in my supervisors.. On our honeymoon we encountered an unexpected financial issue when the rental car company placed an exorbitant hold on our credit card that was going to prevent us from paying for our hotel and for much else. As soon as we found out about it Aaron was already brainstorming some options to correct the situation so that we could get on with enjoying our honeymoon. However, we were in Greece, so contacting people back home or contacting our bank weren’t simple options. Aaron travels quite a bit though, and before leaving for trips he takes the time to research the best ways of taking out money in another country, how to continue phone servicer connecting to Internet so he can reach people if needed, and things like that. He had a solution and the issue was resolved within a couple of hours. I have more of a carefree attitude when it comes to traveling, and I deal with the consequences. Aaron is proactive and eliminates the causes of those consequences. He’s responsible, organized and prepared, which don’t sound like very sexy adjectives, but I appreciate that we were able to enjoy the rest of our honeymoon in peace without worrying about how we’d pay for things, because Aaron dealt with the issue right away. And then he fed me dinner . The Connector/Planner Aaron is jokingly known as the ‘party planner’ within our unit. This is mainly due to the fact that on every deployment he takes it upon himself to plan some sort of excursion, trip, or entertainment. He takes the time to research each location we visitant then puts together a plan for our little groups. It has now become expected foray country we visit Aaron will have a fun plan in place for us. I’ve always appreciated the time he spends putting our little trips together. Members in our unit have a lot of great memories and have become closer because of Aaron.. The Smartest Man in the Room Aaron has a fairly large head. Most of his coworkers, subordinates, and friends have come to believe this because it has to be in order to fit his extra large brain. He is the go to guy for every type of question in the office. It doesn’t matter what the topic is, if you (to include pilots, intel members, and leadership) have a question, you go to Aaron. I’m constantly impressed with the amount of knowledge he can fit in his bighead. Outside of being an expert within our career field, I am mostly impressed with his overall knowledge of Game of Thrones.. Run, Run, Run The Aaron I’ve known for years hates running. Whether he was in an Army uniform or Air Force uniform he has always disliked running and was never quite great at it. I'm not quite sure what changed, but I’ve watched him for the last 18 months change his lifestyle. He consistently eats healthy, works out, and runs. I wouldn’t say he’s fast...not yet at least. But, I’m constantly impressed on the changes he’s made. It takes a lot of discipline to change your lifestyle. Aaron has done it and rather than just passing our pt test is he setting the example for our shop.. One of Aaron Jensen's best qualities as a leader is his care for the people who he supervises. This was best displayed this previous summer when he fought for me to get a temporary job on base. Although I filled out my paperwork incorrectly, he assisted me in changing my package so that I would be able to make as much money as possible. It would have been easy to take the easy way out and say that since me resume wasn't strong enough, I'd be getting payed less. Instead, he helped me correct everything and I was able to get the pay grade that I wanted.. Aaron Jensen also excels as a communicator. This is extremely important for me specifically as a traditional guardsman who also in college. I was always well informed on what was going on in the unit and what to expect when I arrived for the weekend guard drills. One thing that I have always appreciated is the fact that Msgt Jenson always pushed out opportunities for training or deployments when they became available and were relevant to me. He was also very helpful in helping me figure out some last second details of an overseas TDY that I went on. Since it was my first time traveling outside the country, he walked me through all the steps and made me feel much more comfortable and prepared to train overseas.. Aaron is very good at submitting his troops for well deserved awards and recognitions throughout the wing and group. The intel shop is often times overrepresented based on the size of our shop when it comes to awards time. This is both a testament to his ability to write and submit awards packages as well as his superb training and guidance which develops young intel troops like me into well rounded airmen.",33

It took me a few days to ponder what I wanted to write about because there is just so much I could write about once I get the words to form and this feels to important to just jot something down. When I think about your strengths and the kind of man I have watched you become, only great things come to mind. I think of the man that puts his not only his head into his work but also his heart. You have thrown yourself full force into a career that not only completely surrounds you but one in which you also love and makes you happy; that alone is the American dream. When I think of your strengths I think of your challenges because I believe that you are at your strongest when you are challenged. Your challenges, well, challenge you. They create the obstacles that make you question your morals and invoke your patience and critical thinking; they are constantly pushing you to grow. You have a relentless sense of persistence and perseverance which help navigate you through your hardships. When you are faced with a problem or a difficulty in life, you always seem to find a way to solve it. Through this, you become even a stronger man than you started out as. Time after time I have seen you come out on top. Day after day, night after night, studying in those green and blue rooms. Hour after hour, late night after late night writing out math and circuit problems on that extensively large whiteboard. No matter how many times you would get something wrong you would not stop until you had it correct. Concept after concept you absorbed it like a Mr. Clean sponge. Test after test you came out on top, no matter how little preparation you had. You focus on something and don’t stop until you have conquered it. Now you may bethinking, these are all academic challenges, but really that’s been a big part of your life. OTS is another challenge that life has thrown at you and you will prevail; you will come out on top; you will grow and you will be a better man than you already are fordoing so. Every challenge you face is for a reason, because everything happens for areas on. There is a bigger plan. I have watched you overcome some of your toughest challenges, including myself, and to this day you continue to amaze me by coming out taller when things try to knock you down.. You may be an electrical engineer. Your brain may be wired to pick things apart and put them back together again just to see how they work and you may be in the Air Force, but for me your biggest strength has nothing to do with your career. Instead, it has everything to do with your heart. Yes, you could say your heart is in your career and while I love watching your eyes light up and your mind go into overdrive when you talk about work, my heart goes into overdrive when your heart makes an appearance. My favorite strength of yours is that you’re a family man. You have an inherent nature that gravitates you towards the man of the house/fatherly type of role. I think of the man that cannot wait to build and dedicate himself to a family one day. One who has so much to teach to and learn from his little humans. From that first cry to the scary first drive home from the hospital to teaching them how to walk and talk to then dancing around in the kitchen with them while their mother makes dinner to finding the boundaries of discipline when they smear poop all over the playroom walls to teaching them not only how to respect their mother but also women in general while also respecting themselves to teaching them how to make a potato clock or volcano for their science fair to building snowmen and igloos and having snowball fights to helping them find their place in this world and everything else in between. I knew you would be an amazing father right from the moment I was writing out baby names on the whiteboard in the green room and we both realized that our top baby girl name was Isabella; this was only further proven when you were brought into Hayden’s life. You’re strength of devotion to your family is incredibly visible and is honestly one of the biggest reasons I fell in love with you. There is not a single time I can think of where your dad has needed you that you have not been there; from tending to the garden, to making new food plots, to driving posts in the hot sun, he knows he can always count on you. You’re a man that is always there for everyone else, despite what else is going on in your life; you’re the man that your father is so incredibly proud of. With this strength, you have created a support system that will always be there to get you through whatever you cannot on your own.. One step at a time. Day by day. You can do this. I know it and you know it. xoxo always,-Coach. Jordan is a guy that will never say no. He is always looking to visit with friends and have a good time. He is always the life of the party. One time Jordan, some friends, and I were on vacation, sitting around looking for something to do. Jordan was pushing us to all get up, and go out and see the town. He led us on this adventure around the town that I will never forget. Jordan is a great motivator and a great leader. He is someone that I would get up to follow anywhere.. Jordan is also an excellent mentor and friend. I can recall several occasions where we had a big test in a class at school. Regardless of where Jordan was in his studying process, he was always willing to sit down with you and go through some material with you, to try to help you learn it better. He has always been very selfless. Jordan would help me with anything if he knew that I would benefit from it, that is just the kind of guy that he is. I think throughout Jordan’s life, in everything he did, he wanted to make people better. I personally have felt like I have been a better person because I have been friends with Jordan.. Another instance where Jordan has shown great character is when it comes to testing, or homework. There is so many temptations now throughout the college education system where cheating has become a much easier alternative then studying hard for a test, or doing the homework. I have never seen Jordan take this route. Jordan always studied very hard for exams and homework, ensuring that he really understood the material. He did not want to just learn the material for a day, he wanted to make sure that he got every bit and piece of it. Jordan is a very standup guy, that I believe would work effectively in any job setting.. One of the times when I was probably at my lowest and Jordan and I decided to get together with friends, Jordan showed his strength by being there for me and giving me someone to trust in and confide in. Jordan not only lent an ear but also took care of me in making sure I got home safe that night when I was at a point where I could not do that for myself. I'll never forget how Jordan also confided in me that same night and it in turn I believe was one of the building blocks to our friendship. We established a very open and trusting relationship that night and even though it wasn't a very proud moment for myself, I'll never forget the kindness and gentleness I was shown from Jordan.. When Jordan and I were attending school together, around the time we met, he had the kind of character I aspired to also have at the time. He was focused and did very well in his studies, while also maintaining an incredible friend group and being sure to have fun. The ability to balance the rigorous courses we were taking along with family, and friends, and fun was a quality I was extremely envious of at the time. He always seemed to be very cool, calm, and collected regardless of what was thrown at him. His desire to stick with the program and see it through really showed me how dedicated he was to his future and I've always admired that quality about him.. Other qualities of Jordan's that I appreciate are his honesty, his willingness to grow, and his dedication to friendship. I don't believe I have ever heard him truly talk down on any of his friendships, even if it was a past one in which he has grown out of. He also has no problem seeing where he may be lacking and working on that. This is a quality difficult to find in peers. Regardless of if he comes to the conclusion himself or if someone may point something out to him, he takes it with confidence and is always striving to better himself. Lastly, his dedication to friendship. Knowing that both he and I were moving, Jordan set aside a day just for us to share. It meant a lotto me to have more than just a meal with him, but to share that full day and to have the conversations we had. He is very intentional about the friendships he has which I believe is a quality we share, but again, one that can be difficult to come by.. Jordan Kottwitz was nominated and elected as the Executive Vice President of Student Council for the School of Computing and Engineering from 2015-2016. After our president resigned, the vice president assumed the rolls of the president and at the time he was in the secretary position. He was nominated to become the vice president because of how well he was doing the duties as the secretary. Everyone on the Executive Board for student council, which includes other elected positions and administration, voted for this movement. He helped out with many things for the students of the engineering school to have a more better and enjoyable experience on campus.. Jordan was one of the brightest students in our electrical and computer engineering class. He is hard working and deserves every good outcome. Jordan mainly spent time with myself and a few other mutual friends during the 3 years he was at UMKC and I remember there being times when the class average on exam grades were C's and he would be getting A's. Jordan is a quick learner and can adapt to situations with much ease.. To continue with Story 2 but with a different point, Jordan is also very patient and has the willingness to help others. Jordan, myself, and the other friends would always study together for the exams a few days prior to the exam date. Whenever someone in the group didn't really understand something, he would always take the time to help them out on learning the concepts. Even if he didn't really understand it either, he would always spend the time to talk it through with one of us to try and figure it out. The point with this story is that he is very patient and not self centered. During school he always tried his best to help others out.. I'm certain that being Jordan's dad has been the greatest experience in my life! I hope all dads feel that way. Jordan has always been a strong independent person. One of my early memories of him showing strength and judgement was at about the age of seven. We accompanied our school's 5th & 6th grade summer school class on an overnight camping and canoe trip. We canoed with another parent in the front and Jordan in the middle of our canoe. While canoeing, a student in a canoe ahead of us had a serious emotional episode in which they jumped out of their canoe and took their life jacket off. We pulled our canoe over and I got out to help the student. I told Jordan to take my place in the canoe and to wait upstream unless I needed our canoe. We got the student calmed down and everything was fine. I was impressed that Jordan knew exactly what I needed him to do!. For most of Jordan's childhood we spent summers raising and selling produce at the local farmer's markets. The best days for me were when we went to market together. Even at an early age he was always a great worker! He quickly learned the skills needed for dealing with customers. Jordan always counted change back to the customer, a skill that is almost lost in today's world, but one our older customers really appreciated. He also made a point to know the variety names of all the vegetables for when people would ask! I enjoyed the time together and I know our customers enjoyed having a smart, confident, young man waiting on them!. I guess every parent worries about the time when their kid will leave home! For me it came earlier than most. At around 6th grade Jordan set his goal of starting college early through the Missouri Academy of Science Mathematics and Computing. One of the first requirements is a high ACT test score. To achieve this meant taking the test beginning in junior high. The lengthy application process for the Missouri Academy takes place during the sophomore year of high school as well as completing Algebra I and Chemistry that year. Of course I was supportive of the process, but never had to remind him of a goal or deadline. In the spring of his sophomore year we were notified of his acceptance into the Missouri Academy. In the fall Jordan, at the age of16, would start college 4 hours away from home! I was excited for him, but also knew how much I would miss him! Move in day finally arrived and then the moment when I had to leave. We went for a walk around campus before saying goodbye. I knew it was where he belonged, but that didn't make the drive home any shorter. As the weeks went by I knew, from the Facebook posts and our conversations, that he was making friends and adapting to college life. His name on the Honor Roll proved that he could attain a goal that he set. I'm extremely proud of Jordan and hope he will always remember his time at the Missouri Academy with positive thoughts.. If it was not for you Jordan, I cannot imagine myself being able to have made it through the Academy. When I first arrived, I had never faced so many challenges. However, when I remember studying for exams or doing homework, I remember you helping me across from a round table surrounded by bright green walls. You were instrumental in my success. Not only because of your intelligence, but because you were always there to help guide me and everyone else through our problems and use your understanding to help us learn as well. Where others would simply give me the answer to the problem rather than explaining their thought process, you would help walk me step-by-step in front of the whiteboard to ensure that I would be able to understand what I was doing. You never took the easy way out when it came to helping others, which showed me you possess an unrivalled level of patience and compassion. It would have been much easier for you to simply focus on yourself, but you did not. However, you never let people abuse this quality of yours because you had equally unrivalled integrity in your work. When offered chances to cheat or take shortcuts, you denied them and chose to earn the grade for yourself. This is one of the qualities I most respect about you.. I have met few people who relate to their family and friends in the way you do, and I think this is epitomized by your relationship to your dad. While visiting, I have distinct memories of you talking with your father over the phone. Just by the tone of your voice and the things you said, I could tell that your father is a man you deeply care about and respect. Talking with you after your call ended, you told me about how you worried about his happiness and did not want him to feel lonely without you home. Many people, such as myself, take for granted the love and concern their parents show for them. However, in many ways I see you taking on the fatherly role, and that shows to me a great level of maturity and compassion.. Years have now gone by since our experiences at the Academy, and I still consider you to be my closest friend. When I think back to my best experiences at the Academy, you were there celebrating next to me. When I think back to my worst memories at the Academy, you were there to pick me back up. In many ways, I am the person I am today because of the memories I share with you. No matter how boring and sometimes pointless the residential life committee or student government meetings got, you were there to support me. When I made bad decisions that ultimately led to me resigning as a community leader, you were also there to support me. When I let hate and frustration get the better of me, you were there to help guide me through those times and I have become a better man because of it. There are no truer signs of an excellent comrade and brother than the ones you demonstrated to me through our years of challenges and successes, and I thank you for showing me that. I can never express my full gratitude for the loyalty you have shown me as a friend. You were one of the first people I ever came out to, and not only did you not change the way you treated me, but you found ways to relate to me and make me feel accepted for who I am. When I had relationship troubles, I felt comfortable talking to you and receiving advice. I have yet to find someone that is as open-minded and empathetic as you have been to me, and I feel lucky to have had a friend with those qualities when I was discovering myself.. Jordan is someone who will always get the job done regardless of how valuable or worthless his coworkers/teammates are. The latter was the case in his senior design group where we had to develop, design, and construct a fully autonomous robot. The lot of Jordan’s teammates provided next to nothing in the entirety of the class, which spanned an entire year. Rather than follow suit and also provide little contribution, Jordan took charge and built and coded their entire robot. I always admired his ability to disregard what was or wasn’t “fair” to him and still find a way to complete the task at hand.. Jordan is a remarkably reliable friend. I feel we live among a generation of people who can’t seem to give you a straight “yes” or “no”. It’s always, “I might be able to ""or “I’ll just have to see”. Regardless of what the question is, Jordan is always willing to be the person that answers the call. He’s the kind of guy who would give you a ride to work if your car unexpectedly broke down; he’s the kind of guy you’d putdown as an emergency contact because you know that he will be there when you need him the most.. Jordan makes the people around him better at what they do. Going through the same Bachelor's program meant that Jordan and I had nearly all the same classes together. It seemed like on every test or quiz, we were challenging each other to be the best. I always felt that my level of interest and effort in my course work was heightened in the pursuit of competing with Jordan. It was always implicit too. I believe that’s what makes Jordan an excellent leader.",21

When you got picked up for OTS and the more I talked to you, I thought that's something that is achievable if I work towards it. You helped me along the way as I got my package together and never complained as I asked you question after question. It was all of the little things that you did and helped me out with that kept me believing I would be selected. When I was selected you were one of the first people to know because your help meant a lot to me and I wanted to share that success with you.. You care a great deal about those around you. When Nystrom was being separated I saw how you helped him anyway you could and it was evident that that meant a lotto him at his going away. You went out of your way to make sure he got something other than the standard plaque to let him know that he will be missed and was a valuable team member.. Overall you set the example of what it takes to get ahead the right way. I never saw you step on people or throw anyone under the buss. You worked your ass off and your awards were proof of that.. Jonathan is a dedicated family man. He would always speak fondly of his wife and children, and they were a big part of his military career as well. Many days I would walk around the back of the laboratory, checking in on my Airmen, and I usually lingered a bit longer than necessary in Jonathan’s work area. He would often speak of his daughter and wife, and brought them into the laboratory often. This hit me the hardest when he found out he was selected for OTS. It was during a morning formation with our Squadron Commander who had just stopped by to pass on some information. He was nearing the end of his presentation and he casually stated “and oh yeah... SSgt Teer got selected for OTS”. Jon just sat there... it was so out of the blue. He had been hounding me for days asking if the Commander had heard any results (one of Jon’s qualities that makes him so successful is his persistence), but I had heard nothing up until that moment the news dropped. The lab went crazy in excitement for him (a testament to his popularity garnered through respect, hard work and dedication to duty).I caught Jon out at the smoke pit and he was on the phone with his wife and had a tear in his eye. I tried not to listen it, but it was obvious she was proud of him and it meant the world to him that she was on his team in life. I told him to get out of there and be with his family; he had earned it.. Jonathan is a technical expert. He is a mature Airmen, but was still relatively new in the career field versus some of his peers...but that didn’t stop him from being one of the best maintainers I have seen. Many times I would see him working on a piece of equipment other Airmen were afraid to touch, or take over a piece of gear for someone that was lost on what to do next. He also possesses a high level of patience, and coupling that with his technical expertise, he is a very effective trainer. Our laboratory was reduced to its lowest manning level in over 20 years with an increasing workload. How did we keep our heads above water and provide a quality product to the customer? Through effective training to grow new technicians. Jon’s expertise helped mold a new set of technicians to increase our task coverage. Without his efforts, we would have missed deadlines and put missions at risk. His patience and knowledge transcended technical work into military customs, courtesies and overall professionalism. He was my first stop whenever I had to prepare an Airman or NCO for an awards board. Having one multiple awards at varying levels (including the coveted John L. Levitow during ALS), he knew how to present himself and was an excellent coach for others. He gave frank feedback during mock boards and aided the Flight in securing a multitude of team wins all the way up to the Wing level.. Jonathan is a dedicated supervisor. I never had to worry about him accomplishing his duties for subordinates. If I had 30 Airmen EPRs due and 29 of them were late tome... Jon’s was the exception. He was always on task when it came time to making sure he met his deadlines and provided the best product he could. Jon's time management skills outpaced his fellow NCOs in keeping track of his deadlines and providing quality products on-time. He would continually engage with leadership to ensure he was on track to meet his suspense and provide the best possible result for his assigned subordinates be it decorations, Performance Feedback or SrA below the zone packages. He was also a very visible, positive influence to the young Airmen in our work-section. His perseverance and hard work garnered a multitude of awards. There was a mantle (that Jon and his section got self-help to put up) where the Electrical Standards Airmen (Jon’s area) would display all of their awards. The shelf was 90%Jon! Other Airmen would see those achievements and ask “how can I do that”... it was a nice problem to have; too many motivated Airmen to recognize at once. Jon's educational endeavors were also a source of inspiration. His success in achieving a Bachelor’s Degree in Electronic Engineering WHILE being an NCO WHILE being a father/husband were impressive. My inbox was constantly flooded with Tuition Assistance requests, and I happily approved them all (provided they met standards). Jon’s presence help create an environment that grew well educated, professional and technically competent Airmen.. When I saw Johnathan at his best was briefing visitors to the PMEL. He was always very professional and articulate. He always had a calm and cool demeanor and never let any nerves shows when briefing leaders ranging from the A4 to the Group Commander. No matter who it was Johnathan was able to dumb down PMEL jargon and help the common Airman understand what a lab does for the Air Force. He was always willing to step up and volunteer to lead the tours through the lab. His actions were a positive example for the younger Airmen to emulate.. Johnathan was always involved in the flight even though he had a lot going on in his personal life. He was one of the first students to complete an Electrical Engineering degree completely online. With the burden of providing for his family he always managed to be an integral part of the flight and it’s activities. This set the example for the flight’s airmen to see. You can balance all the different facets of life and still maintain superior performance.. A strength of Johnathan's was the ability to reach out and assist others. Once he was accepted to OTS, Jonathan helped a few other Airmen interested in earning their commission with their packages. His help was key to helping another Airman in the flight be selected to attend OTS.. Fit, both in Mind and Body Jon Teer and his wife, Faith, were neighbors of ours in Navarre Florida. After moving to Florida, I learned quickly that Jon was working on a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering. Very often, in the evening, I would see Jon spending time with his wife, going on a walk; these walks often lasted an hour. They went on a walk as a family every single evening. Even when the work day had been long and even when there was much homework to complete, Jon and his family would spend time together. That Jon maintained this practice during a time where he was working full-time and going to school full-time for his bachelor’s in electrical engineering. He combined spending time with his wife, talking, and exercising. This touches on aspects of Jon's life that are approached with discipline and thoughtfulness.- Maj Timothy Pitzer. Continuous Learner Recently, Jon Teer applied for OTS and was selected. Upon graduation and commissioning, he will become an Acquisition Engineer which requires additional training through Defense Acquisition University (DAU). DAU offers training that is often not utilized heavily until becoming a 1st Lieutenant or young Captain but Jon spent time learning what training Acquisition Officers require and getting ahead on DAU certifications, even before commissioning as an Officer. This showed great initiative and a hunger for constant learning.- Maj Timothy Pitzer. Excellence in All Things Jon Teer has been making strides at work, finding himself singled out with praise by supervisors and commanders as well as garnering an Air Force Level award. He joined the Air Force in his late twenties and has quickly made rank to SSgt. After meeting Jon, I learned that he was interested in commissioning through OTS as an Air Force Officer. Jon quickly sought out my help, asking for guidance and suggestions as he put together his OTS application. The level of effort Jon put into developing and submitting an OTS application was immense. He ensured that he was well-informed on the implications for being chosen, the impacts that had on his family, and the nature of how he could continue to contribute to the Air Force mission. He was scrutinous as he cited the marks he had gained, inside and out of the work environment, affirming that no marks were inflated but instead factual. It was no surprise to me, having reviewed Jon’s OTS application, that Jon was selected to attend the commissioning source training at Maxwell AFB. The excellence Jon exhibits in all matters of life is a tribute to the training he has received in the Air Force and the manner in which he consistently conducts himself.- Maj Timothy Pitzer. Teer is one of the most personable individuals that I have had the pleasure of knowing and working with. His personality was one that made it easy for him to get along with just about anyone. I recall him being assigned as the rater of an individual that was difficult to work with. I don’t mean that he was a bad person, or had behavior issues. He was just a very hard person to get to open up. It was a struggle to find out how his weekend was, so to get information from him to write an EPR for him was a challenge. He was also struggling to make progress with his training. Most people just left this guy alone, limiting interactions to what was required for work and letting him fail to progress. Teer was also unsuccessful in his first attempts to get a feel for him and to get him to open up, but he didn’t give up. After several weeks, he was able to get more information out of him to get a better understanding of him. It turns out the guy had a tough childhood, and had some abandonment issues. Once that information was brought to light, it changed the way that people saw him, and brought more understanding to the situation. Eventually, Teer was replaced, but the information gained from him allowed his new rater to connect with him faster and he was able to find out what his motivation was and he was even able to assist him with his decision to re-enlist. While Teer was not the one that changed his mind, without him and his caring about people, this individual would have been labelled as a lost cause and left to fail.. Begin with the end in mind is what I get from Teer. No matter what it was that he was doing, he always knew what he wanted the end result to be. I remember when I found that he wanted to be an Officer. Everything he did was thought out and used to accomplish that goal. The way he interacted with people was to prepare him for that role. When he would volunteer for anything, it was to get experience to be able to either lead it the next time, or coach someone through it. He also sought out the more difficult tasks at work to expand and develop his knowledge. Teer was also going to school to obtain a degree in electrical engineering, with a demanding schedule and workload. He was able to accomplish all of this while being the primary provider for his family. All of this was recognized by management and he earned many awards and even more respect. His hard work, dedication, and sleep deprivation led to him earning the opportunity to go to OTS to make full use of his potential and be a leader in the Air Force, as well as being prepared for whatever he may choose to do once he has completed his Air Force career. When I first started working with Teer, I was not happy. It wasn’t because he was a bad guy, but because it was easy for him to make you look bad. His work ethic and easy going personality are hard to beat. I remember when I was put in charge of our section. It was supposed to be a very short term as I didn’t have the proper rank. There was a series of events that made it necessary for me to hold the position for an extended period. Teer stepped into the role of lead section trainer, and filled in for me in my absence. The section was operating in top condition due in no small part to Teer's promotion of excellent work ethic, top notch training and guidance, and his encouragement of teamwork. As a matter of fact, he was one of the most sought after technicians in the lab even when we were over manned. While that makes him someone you don’t want to be in competition with, it makes him one of the greatest assets to any organization that he works for, one of the best people to work with, and a great friend. Whenever he is involved in anything, there is little to worry about, even if it is going wrong, he will find the way to make the best of the situation, and does not make the same mistake twice.. The best way to convey Jon's most notable strengths and attributes is to share with the reader how Jon made it to OTS in the first place. Jon set a goal of making it to OTS before his enlisted career even began, and the uphill climb to get there started as early as tech school. During this time he was adjusting to a later-in-life decision to join the Air Force while his pregnant wife and son were adjusting to this new life, too, but Jon made the transition smoothly. Shortly after settling in at his first duty station I gave birth to our daughter and Jon juggled a newborn and a new career effortlessly, and even enrolled in an electrical engineering program to earn the bachelors degree that he hoped would lead him to OTS. I can't articulate into words just how hard it was to be a parent, husband, full-time student, and exemplary Airman all at once, but Jon was able to master all of these roles. He never complained. He never quit. He never failed. Jon won multiple awards during his time at Eglin, though never letting his responsibilities to school or home life take a back seat, and he went on to graduate with distinction from Arizona State University. Wearing multiple hats is difficult for anyone, but wearing multiple hats and far exceeding expectations while doing so is the stuff that great leaders are made of. Jon exemplifies what it means to be trustworthy, hardworking, loyal, and whip-smart, and there is no doubt that he will excel in his role as an officer.. Another example of one of Jon's many strengths is his resolve to be a problem-solver in the most unique ways. While he could share a number of stories about ways in which he solved problems at work, I think it is important to highlight the ways in which he uses his problem solving skills in his home life, too. Jon is incredibly resourceful and inventive and will often find ways to build things or repair things around the house in order to solve a problem or make life a little easier. But he is also the kind of husband and father who is not too proud to sit behind a sewing machine and make his daughter custom dresses in order to be more frugal and to make sure that his daughter has the clothing that she wants. After I spent a small fortune on custom dresses for our daughter, Jon said that he was going to learn how to sew so that our daughter could have the custom dresses she wants, but we wouldn't have to spend a lot of money to provide them for her. If you think about this, it is really quite remarkable--here is this very manly-man who is already busy with work and school and all of the other things he has going on simultaneously, but he wanted his daughter to have this clothing that she wanted (and I wanted for her),so he took the time to teach himself to use a sewing machine and follow a pattern, just so his child could reasonably have these articles of clothing. This is but one of many unique ways in which Jon solves problems and makes things happen. His resourcefulness is an incredible strength, for certain.. Jonathan’s care for others success is a key trait in his leadership style. Having made Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts, he continued to dedicate time out of his day to help me succeed. I was having trouble attaining a patch, or qualification. I had failed the examination twice and only had one more chance to pass it and earn the patch. Jonathan dedicated his time and energy to quiz me throughout the day while we were riding in the car to and from school, at the dinner table, and while we were doing outside activities. His devotion to my success led to me passing my examination and earning the qualification. Part of being a great leader is taking pride in the success of those you lead, and when necessary dedicating your time to aid in that success.. Assertiveness can be a great asset to a leader. Jonathan’s assertiveness has been apart of his personality his entire life. When he sold cars for Toyota, his assertiveness with his customers earned him enormous customer loyalty. Whether it was informing them of the best deal, or fighting for them to his superiors to get them in a car, Jonathan spoke his mind and let his desires be known. Jonathan is not one to keep his thoughts to himself. When he sees that things are being operated inefficiently, he speaks up. That’s the first step in improving the status quo. Jonathan’s assertive will serve him well in leadership positions.. Jonathan’s concern for other’s issues both professional and personal will aid him as a leader. When we were younger, a very personal issue arose and he was the one person I went to with it. He stayed by my side and helped me through it. No matter when, where, or how much it inconvenienced him he made sure to be there for my support, both mentally and physically. Being aware of his people’s issues and showing concern and aid in those issues will be a strong advantage for Jonathan in his leadership style.. Salesmanship – Jonathan exceled at selling various items to individuals with a need. Be it appliances, tools or automobiles he was always compassionate to their needs, reservations and financial constraints. He would greet the customer cordially, make small talk to set them at ease, and find out their needs. Then he would direct them to the item that generally ‘fit’ their needs. Customers who returned would always ask for Jonathan because of his easy disposition, honesty and helpfulness. He received several ‘salesman of the month’ awards and earned other achievement incentives through dedicated work.. Perseverance – Jonathan possessed the grit and stick-to-itiveness to complete any project or task he undertook. While in Scouting Jonathan decided he wanted to become an Eagle Scout, an undertaking that only five percent of scouts achieve because of the difficulty. A Scout must earn 21 merit badges, 13 are required which include Citizenship; Personal Management; Communication and Family Life. These merit badges strengthened his character and personal beliefs. CPR, Lifeguard and Arrow of Light were challenges that tested his resolve yet he still accomplished through perseverance.. Ambition – Jonathan achieved his Associates Degree from Dyersburg State Community College and decided to move into the business world instead of continuing on to a four year degree. He did very well, however something was missing. He decided to join the Air Force as an enlisted airman with the hopes of perhaps becoming an officer in the future. After boot-camp, schooling and passing the E4 and E5 advancement exams Jonathan knew then that he wanted to become an officer. Following diligent research he enrolled in online college courses working toward his four year college degree. Jonathan’s drive to complete the degree program while working full time and taking care of his family was exceptional! He achieved his degree and graduated with honors; then submitted for, and was accepted to become, an officer in the United States Air Force.. One of Jonathan Teer’s strengths is his ability to readily and effectively accomplish tasks outside of his normal duties. Jon was able to troubleshoot and repair test equipment that is irreplaceable. = Identifying a need, recommending a solution and using his mechanical skills to complete a project that was crucial to his team continuing to meet the demands of the Department of Defense, highlights his unique mindset among his peers.. Jonathan Teer exhibited compassion in helping a medically disadvantaged youth. He took the initiative to arrange a fighter aircraft and facility tour that involved making contacts far above his pay grade and outside of his normal chain of supervision. As a young man with little if any professional contacts outside of our organization, he impressed his leadership with his ability to organize and highlight the Air Force mission from a relatively low position of authority.. Jonathan quickly exceeded the goals set for him and became a technical expert in his assigned duties and mastered tasks well outside of what was expected. He was a masterful trainer, ensuring that new Airmen who worked their way through his section received the skills they needed to excel on their own.",26

When Christopher was assigned to pass out MRE's and made sure they were passed out when and where they were needed.. Christopher is willing to take feedback from his flight and makes it a point to do better.. Christopher is a good wingman and it is visible when he helps out Cadet Lane.. Christopher likes to fully explore all possibilities while evaluating a problem. This allows him to fully think out his plan of action.. Christopher has experience briefing high ranking individuals giving him great public speaking skills. He communicates well with others.. Christopher is not afraid to ask for help. No matter how small the task or even how much involvement he might need from others, he is always willing to ask and complimentary of those who help.. One of his strengths includes self-awareness. Since coming to OTS, he has learned to stop and understand each situation to the fullest extent. I say this in regards to the people he's interacting with, how he presents himself, and his will to understand other's perspective.. He also is very insightful. He uses his prior service to add to classroom discussions. His knowledge is an asset to any team he his a part of.. Another strength of his is that he is resilient. Despite making mistakes, he has the resiliency to apply what he has learned from mistakes and improve for next situations he may face.. There was this one we were marching to the shooting range and we did not know where to go. You promptly and properly halted us and then rushed over to ask some gentlemen for directions. That was hilarious. More importantly, it showed that you are ready to do what you need to at any moment. You knew you needed directions, you made a quick decision and committed to it.. One time you came up to me and said we haven't talked in a while and that was really nice. You really keep up with your people and that's very nice to see.. You really care about the flight. That is evident with all your actions.. Christopher is a hard working guy. I thought he did a fantastic job with figuring out his LRO tasks early on. Namely, he quickly and effectively figured out how to feed everyone and then distributed MREs .. Cadet Doyle is very articulate and has the knowledge to establish a supportive argument. He has mentioned that he plans on becoming a lawyer and I think that is the perfect career field for him. He is sharp and know how to have a solid debate.. Has a passionate attitude towards every goal he sets. Cadet Doyle has the capability to establish milestones and objectives This is critical for a team, it provides goals fora team to work towards..

You have pushed through your high school's IB program, college engineering courses, and your extensive senior design project. I have seen you take on many tasks, no matter how daunting they may seem. My most fond memory of you displaying perseverance happened during the time you were preparing for Officer Training School. After you were told that you had to lose over 50 pounds to be considered you went into training mode. You went to the gym every day after leaving class, changed your entire diet so that it was more conducive to your weight loss goal, and you completed mock PT tests at home to see what you needed to improve before the real PT test. Meeting your weight requirement was not the most impressive though. I was most proud of you when I observed how you responded to your AFOQT results. We were both confident that you passed the test, but then we were met with disappointment when reading the results. Even when failure looked like it was the only outcome, you did not give up. You reached out to Sgt. Hartman to see if there was another way to be considered for this program. Your perseverance has brought you to this point. I have no doubt that you will go even farther in life because of it.. Another strength of yours that I have noticed is your intelligence. I admire the fact that you don't remain ignorant. If there is something that you need to know, you will do your research until you find an answer. I remember hearing about how excited Rachel was when she earned a higher grade than you on an assessment. The reason being is that everyone has seen how smart you are. You set the bar high and if anyone is able to meet or exceed that they get a sense of accomplishment. Not only are you intelligent, you also try to help me become smarter in the engineering world. You explain information that you learned about in laymen's term so that I can understand it easier. If that does not work, then you will include pictures to help make connections for me. Being intelligent and knowing how to teach content is what great leaders are made of.. Although you have many strengths that I admire, my most favorite strength of yours is how selfless you are. You tend to put other people before yourself to make sure they are taken care of. I have personally experienced your selflessness, but it brings so much joy to my heart when I observe you acting that way towards your mom. I remember having a conversation a few years ago about scholarships for college. During that conversation you told me that you wanted to win more scholarships. I was confused because your tuition was already paid at that time, but then you explained how you wanted to use it to help your mom with her bills. With each employment and scholarship won, you have used a portion to help your mom with her bills and living expenses. At 23 years old you have taken on the role of the breadwinner for your family. Rather than refusing this responsibility, you have welcomed it and made it your goal to make sure you and your mom are both financially set. Your family is proud of what you have accomplished and so am I.. Cadet Lane is very observant.. I don't have a lot of experience with Phillip. In the limited experience that I do have, he has displayed a strength in knowledge. He is an extremely intelligent individual who reserves his opinion for when the group dynamics need it.. Cadet Lane has impressed me with his academic knowledge. The lessons and things seem to come natural to him. That's a big deal in a fast paced learning environment like this. Cadet Lane pretty much volunteered to be Cadet Doyle's 2IC. That was an impressive show of desire to grow.. Cadet Lane started the class really quiet, but in recent weeks, he's taken a more active role in the flight, which demonstrates his ability to take input from others and strive to improve.. Phillip grew up in a single parent home, with his mom and his older sister. At the age of three I noticed that Phillip was a very intelligent child. I started teaching him his ABC's and within two weeks Phillip had learned all of them, and also could count to50. Phillip started per-k when he was four years old, and he's a very quick learner. He would be one of the first students to finish his assignments. And his teacher checked his work and than she would ask Phillip to help other students that were having a hard time. And Phillip would always say ""OK"". At a very young age Phillip has always showed leadership by helping others in need.. This is a story that Phillip wrote about himself when he was 14 years old. If I could change one thing in my life it would be having more money because I want to be able to buy anything I want when I want it and I want to be be able to help people. It's not that I don't have enough money I just want more. When I see something, I want to be able to buy it without having to save 12 months. Going to college will be my stepping stone for more education and with education comes money. After high school I plan to attend a 4yr college and pursue my degree in the medical field. I knew from day one that I wanted to be a doctor because I love helping others. To accomplish this goal I have continue to make straight A's on my report card. I've become an expert on the computer and am very skilled with word and power point. I read books about doctors working on soldiers in Iraq. I feel if you make one person's life better, than yours is successful. I've dedicated my life making my mother happy and her life better. I do this by maintaining a positive attitude and doing all the chores around the house. I make her proud with how well I do in school and plan to make her even more proud when I attend college. Getting into college is my life-long dream. I will be valedictorian of my class both in high school and in college. My friends characterize me as very outgoing. Everyone I go to school with wishes they could be as smart and motivated as I am. I use my influence on my friends to help them strive in school and try to get into college. I feel it's my way of contributing to my society by helping those closest to me. Instead of telling them what to do I show them the way and lead by example. My friends love my sense of humor and the fact that I'm always striving for the future. I feel it's most important to make a good impression. This is why I always apply myself and work extremely hard at anything I plan to accomplish. I'm very impressive in an interview situation. Most people would be nervous, however, I use interviews as a time to highlight the characteristics and qualities of myself. I would be a wonderful contribution to any environment because of my aforementioned attributes. My role model is my sister. She's always been therefor me and she's incredibly intelligent. She's in the United States Air Force and always sends money home to help my mother and I. She encourages me to excel in my studies. I talk with her for motivation. and we discuss my future. I trust her with my life and know she will always be there for me. In the process of making my mother proud I will also maker her proud. I'm extremely blessed with a wonderful family. In conclusion getting into college is very important to me in my Endeavor to help others and keep making my mother and sister proud of me. I have an incredibly bright future. I will always take care of those who are in need. I will be the absolute best doctor in the world and have all the money necessary to buy what I want and to help people in need.-Phillip Lane. Phillip has always been an intelligent person and shows great leadership. In high school most of Phillipe's classes were I.B. and with I.B. classes there were extra work and extra homework. They were college classes. Phillip worked hard to succeed. When he graduated from high school his GPA were 4.27. After high school Phillip attended the University of Central Florida. While attending UCF Phillip volunteered his time to school activities, he also was a math tutor. When I became unemployed and disabled, Phillip joined the United States Air Force while attending school to help his mom, so that I would not become homeless. Phillip is a caring person, he loves helping people and he will be a great leader in the United States Air Force.. I appreciate Phillip's common sense, willingness to learn, and his personal and engineering council. I will remember conversations that keep us both on the path to success for years to come.. Cadet Lane is able to learn and recall lesson material in a fast pace environment. He possess self discipline to focus on his studies and exceed.. Cadet Lane shows interest/ excitement on future goals with new career field.. Cadet Lane has displayed the ability to grow in an OTS training environment.",15

She genuinely cares about the well being of others. She takes an interest in others for who they are as people.. No matter how you perform around Ashley, she will always pick you up at the end with a kind comment. She understands that people need positive reinforcement.. Ashley has taken time out of her day to fix other people's computer issues. She understands that to take care of people is to take care of the mission.. She is very insightful and can break-down situations into simpler parts.. I frequently ask for her opinions and feedback on how to conduct myself and work with others in a codependent environment. Her prior experiences is invaluable.. During class discussions, she gives insightful answers using her prior experience. This leads to everyone being able to grasp an understanding of the lesson form an operational perspective.. She can adapt to any situation. During LRC, she was required to use another personas the team leader instead of her herself. This was a challenge as communication became even more important. For any physical movement Cadet Widdifield wanted to make, she need to ensure an additional person acting in her place received that info.. You are very friendly and approachable right from the first meeting. When we used to form up outside for drill practice or anything like that I would always gravitate towards you. You are so easy to talk to, even if someone doesn't know you at all.. We were at the golf course once and we were talking about something and you knew so much about it. Oh yeah, we were talking about you applying to OTS and you were so respectful throughout your story even though anyone else in your position would be rude or something like that. That just goes to show what a great person you are.. Whenever I look at you sitting in class you are always having a conversation with someone about your personal lives and you're always trying to get to know people. Then you remember what they tell you and you're a great listener.. It makes me happy when Ashley tells me stories about the whale calls that come from her tummy.. I enjoyed our short workout together. It's always nice to talk to Ashley. I appreciate the realness that you bring to my life here at OTS.. Ashley approached me with a welcoming conversation about whisky. It's nice to find someone with whom you have something like that in common. Once again, she has brought a little bit of the best part of life into my life.",12
